  Abstract                 = {{Compressed sensing has revolutionized signal acquisition, by enabling complex signals to be measured with remarkable fidelity using a small number of so-called incoherent sensors. We show that molecular interactions, e.g., protein--DNA interactions, can be analyzed in a directly analogous manner and with similarly remarkable results. Specifically, mesoscopic molecular interactions act as incoherent sensors that measure the energies of microscopic interactions between atoms. We combine concepts from compressed sensing and statistical mechanics to determine the interatomic interaction energies of a molecular system exclusively from experimental measurements, resulting in a '' de novo'' energy potential. In contrast, conventional methods for estimating energy potentials are based on theoretical models premised on a priori assumptions and extensive domain knowledge. We determine the de novo energy potential for pairwise interactions between protein and DNA atoms from (i) experimental measurements of the binding affinity of protein--DNA complexes and (ii) crystal structures of the complexes. We show that the de novo energy potential can be used to predict the binding specificity of proteins to DNA with approximately 90\% accuracy, compared to approximately 60\% for the best performing alternative computational methods applied to this fundamental problem. This de novo potential method is directly extendable to other biomolecule interaction domains (enzymes and signaling molecule interactions) and to other classes of molecular interactions.}},

  Abstract                 = {It has recently been suggested by 
Mu et al. [Proteins 58, 45 (2005)]
 to use backbone dihedral angles instead of Cartesian coordinates in a principal component analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. Dihedral angles may be advantageous because internal coordinates naturally provide a correct separation of internal and overall motion, which was found to be essential for the construction and interpretation of the free energy landscape of a biomolecule undergoing large structural rearrangements. To account for the circular statistics of angular variables, a transformation from the space of dihedral angles {φn} to the metric coordinate space {xn = cos φn,yn = sin φn} was employed. To study the validity and the applicability of the approach, in this work the theoretical foundations underlying the dihedral angle principal component analysis (dPCA) are discussed. It is shown that the dPCA amounts to a one-to-one representation of the original angle distribution and that its principal components can readily be characterized by the corresponding conformational changes of the peptide. Furthermore, a complex version of the dPCA is introduced, in which N angular variables naturally lead to N eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Applying the methodology to the construction of the free energy landscape of decaalanine from a 300 ns molecular dynamics simulation, a critical comparison of the various methods is given.},

  Abstract                 = {{In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic--isobaric, canonical, and isothermal--isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be useful are discussed.}},

The formal continuum limit of the model is a nonlinear diffusion equation with a diffusivity which can become negative if the adhesion coefficient is sufficiently large. This appears to be related to the presence of spatial oscillations and the development of plateaus (pattern formation) in numerical solutions of the discrete model. A combination of stability analysis of the discrete equations and steady-state analysis of the limiting PDE (and a higher-order correction thereof) can be used to shed light on these and other qualitative predictions of the model.}},

Use of the new trap extends the size range of macroscopic particles accessible to optical trapping and manipulation well into the Rayleigh size regime. Application of this trapping principle to atom trapping is considered.}},

The most common strategies used to validate these models employ statistics from simulation data, such as the eigenvalue spectrum of the inferred rate matrix, which are often associated with large uncertainties. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach, which makes it possible to differentiate between models at a fixed lag time making use of short trajectories. The hierarchical definition of the models allows one to compare instances with any number of states. We apply a conjugate prior for reversible Markov chains, which was recently introduced in the statistics literature. The method is tested in two different systems, a Monte Carlo dynamics simulation of a two-dimensional model system and molecular dynamics simulations of the terminally blocked alanine dipeptide.}},

Kinetic measurements of two tendamistat variants under various solvent conditions reveal, however, that folding occurs in at least two sequential steps through a metastable obligatory intermediate. Depending on the solvent conditions either step can become rate limiting. The activation parameters indicate that the first step represents an enthalpic barrier whereas the second step is an entropic barrier at 25 $\,^{\circ}$C. Our results suggest that initial non-specific collapse precedes formation of native secondary and tertiary structure in tendamistat folding. This points at a distinct route in tendamistat folding and indicates that partially folded metastable intermediates might play an important role in the mechanism of apparent two-state folding.}},

Evidence from folding intermediates and transition states suggests that folding begins locally, and that the formation of native secondary structure precedes the formation of tertiary interactions, not the reverse. Some notable examples in the literature have been interpreted to the contrary. For these examples, we have simulated the local structures that form when folding begins by using the LINUS program with nonlocal interactions turned off. Our results support a hierarchic model of protein folding.}},

  Abstract                 = {{doi: 10.1021/jp051325a Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the effects of different electrostatic treatments on the structure and thermodynamics of a small beta-hairpin forming peptide. Three different electrostatic schemes were considered: regular cutoffs, generalized reaction field (GRF), and particle mesh Ewald (PME), with the peptide modeled using OPLS/AA all-atom force field with explicit TIP3P water. Both the GRF and PME methods yielded results consistent with experiment, with free energy surfaces displaying a single minimum corresponding to the native beta-hairpin structure. In contrast, use of straight cutoffs led to the population of an additional local minimum corresponding to nonhairpin conformations that compete with the formation of the native beta-hairpin at low temperatures. This extra minimum would not be apparent in conventional constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations run for a few nanoseconds. This result points to the critical need of careful sampling of conformational space to assess the quality of different numerical treatments of long-range forces. While differences emerged in the nature of the unfolded states populated using PME and GRF approaches, simulations on the beta-hairpin forming peptide and on two additional control peptides indicate that the GRF treatment of electrostatics offers a satisfactory compromise between accuracy and computational speed for the identification of low-energy conformations. A GRF-based approach emerges as a viable means for treating larger biological systems that would be prohibitively costly to simulate using PME methods.}},

 Markov State Models provide a framework for understanding the fundamental states and rates in the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. We describe an improved protocol for constructing Markov State Models from molecular dynamics simulations. The new protocol includes advances in clustering, data preparation, and model estimation; these improvements lead to significant increases in model accuracy, as assessed by the ability to recapitulate equilibrium and kinetic properties of reference systems. A high-performance implementation of this protocol, provided in MSMBuilder2, is validated on dynamics ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds.

  Abstract                 = {{The reactive flux between folded and unfolded states of a two-state protein, whose coarse-grained dynamics is described by a master equation, is expressed in terms of the commitment or splitting probabilities of the microstates in the bottleneck region. This allows one to determine how much each transition through a dividing surface contributes to the reactive flux. By repeating the analysis for a series of dividing surfaces or, alternatively, by partitioning the reactive flux into contributions of unidirectional pathways that connect reactants and products, insight can be gained into the mechanism of protein folding. Our results for the flux in a network with complex connectivity, obtained using the discrete counterpart of Kramers' theory of activated rate processes, show that the number of reactive transitions is typically much smaller than the total number of transitions that cross a dividing surface at equilibrium.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Diffusion on a low-dimensional free-energy surface is a remarkably successful model for the folding dynamics of small single-domain proteins. Complicating the interpretation of both simulations and experiments is the expectation that the effective diffusion coefficient D will in general depend on the position along the folding coordinate, and this dependence may vary for different coordinates. Here we explore the position dependence of D, its connection to protein internal friction, and the consequences for the interpretation of single-molecule experiments. We find a large decrease in D from unfolded to folded, for reaction coordinates that directly measure fluctuations in Cartesian configuration space, including those probed in single-molecule experiments. In contrast, D is almost independent of Q, the fraction of native amino acid contacts: Near the folded state, small fluctuations in position cause large fluctuations in Q, and vice versa for the unfolded state. In general, position-dependent free energies and diffusion coefficients for any two good reaction coordinates that separate reactant, product, and transition states, are related by a simple transformation, as we demonstrate. With this transformation, we obtain reaction coordinates with position-invariant D. The corresponding free-energy surfaces allow us to justify the assumptions used in estimating the speed limit for protein folding from experimental measurements of the reconfiguration time in the unfolded state, and also reveal intermediates hidden in the original free-energy projection. Lastly, we comment on the design of future single-molecule experiments that probe the position dependence of D directly.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We introduce a method for optically imaging intracellular proteins at nanometer spatial resolution. Numerous sparse subsets of photoactivatable fluorescent protein molecules were activated, localized (to ∼2 to 25 nanometers), and then bleached. The aggregate position information from all subsets was then assembled into a superresolution image. We used this method---termed photoactivated localization microscopy---to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria; in fixed whole cells, we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions, actin within a lamellipodium, and the distribution of the retroviral protein Gag at the plasma membrane.}},

Single exponential kinetics of contact formation are observed on the nanosecond time scale for polypeptides in which donor and acceptor are linked by repeating units of glycine and serine residues. The rates depend on the number of peptide bonds () separating donor and acceptor and show a maximum for the shortest peptides ( = 3) with a time constant ( = 1/) of 20 ns. This sets an upper limit for the speed of formation of the first side-chain contacts during protein folding.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool for modeling both the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems. In addition, they provide a rigorous means to combine information from multiple sources into a single model and to direct future simulations/experiments to minimize uncertainties in the model. However, constructing MSMs is challenging because doing so requires decomposing the extremely high dimensional and rugged free energy landscape of a molecular system into long-lived states, also called metastable states. Thus, their application has generally required significant chemical intuition and hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a toolkit for automating the construction of MSMs called MSMBUILDER (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In this work we demonstrate the application of MSMBUILDER to the villin headpiece (HP-35 NleNle), one of the smallest and fastest folding proteins. We show that the resulting MSM captures both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular dynamics of the system. As a first step toward experimental validation of our methodology we show that our model provides accurate structure prediction and that the longest timescale events correspond to folding.}},

Unfortunately, even the most powerful supercomputers can only simulate small systems for short time scales, leaving modeling of most biologically relevant systems and time scales intractable. In this work, however, we show that molecular simulations driven by adaptive sampling of networks called Markov State Models (MSMs) can yield tremendous time and resource savings, allowing previously intractable calculations to be performed on a routine basis on existing hardware. We also introduce a distance metric (based on the relative entropy) for comparing MSMs. We primarily employ this metric to judge the convergence of various sampling schemes but it could also be employed to assess the effects of perturbations to a system (e.g., determining how changing the temperature or making a mutation changes a system's dynamics).}},

  Abstract                 = {{Understanding molecular kinetics, and particularly protein folding, is a classic grand challenge in molecular biophysics. Network models, such as Markov state models (MSMs), are one potential solution to this problem. MSMs have recently yielded quantitative agreement with experimentally derived structures and folding rates for specific systems, leaving them positioned to potentially provide a deeper understanding of molecular kinetics that can lead to experimentally testable hypotheses. Here we use existing MSMs for the villin headpiece and NTL9, which were constructed from atomistic simulations, to accomplish this goal. In addition, we provide simpler, humanly comprehensible networks that capture the essence of molecular kinetics and reproduce qualitative phenomena like the apparent two-state folding often seen in experiments. Together, these models show that protein dynamics are dominated by stochastic jumps between numerous metastable states and that proteins have heterogeneous unfolded states (many unfolded basins that interconvert more rapidly with the native state than with one another) yet often still appear two-state. Most importantly, we find that protein native states are hubs that can be reached quickly from any other state. However, metastability and a web of nonnative states slow the average folding rate. Experimental tests for these findings and their implications for other fields, like protein design, are also discussed.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Protein folding is a classic grand challenge that is relevant to numerous human diseases, such as protein misfolding diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Solving the folding problem will ultimately require a combination of theory, simulation, and experiment, with theory and simulation providing an atomically detailed picture of both the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding and experimental tests grounding these models in reality. However, theory and simulation generally fall orders of magnitude short of biologically relevant time scales. Here we report significant progress toward closing this gap: an atomistic model of the folding of an 80-residue fragment of the λ repressor protein with explicit solvent that captures dynamics on a 10 milliseconds time scale. In addition, we provide a number of predictions that warrant further experimental investigation. For example, our model's native state is a kinetic hub, and biexponential kinetics arises from the presence of many free-energy basins separated by barriers of different heights rather than a single low barrier along one reaction coordinate (the previously proposed incipient downhill folding scenario).}},

  Abstract                 = {{The understanding of protein--ligand binding is of critical importance for biomedical research, yet the process itself has been very difficult to study because of its intrinsically dynamic character. Here, we have been able to quantitatively reconstruct the complete binding process of the enzyme-inhibitor complex trypsin-benzamidine by performing 495 molecular dynamics simulations of free ligand binding of 100 ns each, 187 of which produced binding events with an rmsd less than 2 \r{A} compared to the crystal structure. The binding paths obtained are able to capture the kinetic pathway of the inhibitor diffusing from solvent (S0) to the bound (S4) state passing through two metastable intermediate states S2 and S3. Rather than directly entering the binding pocket the inhibitor appears to roll on the surface of the protein in its transition between S3 and the final binding pocket, whereas the transition between S2 and the bound pose requires rediffusion to S3. An estimation of the standard free energy of binding gives ΔG$\,^{\circ}$ = -5.2 $\pm$ 0.4 kcal/mol (cf. the experimental value -6.2 kcal/mol), and a two-states kinetic model kon = (1.5 $\pm$ 0.2) × 108 M-1 s-1 and koff = (9.5 $\pm$ 3.3) × 104 s-1 for unbound to bound transitions. The ability to reconstruct by simple diffusion the binding pathway of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process demonstrates the predictive power of unconventional high-throughput molecular simulations. Moreover, the methodology is directly applicable to other molecular systems and thus of general interest in biomedical and pharmaceutical research.}},

Few techniques presently exist that are capable of monitoring such transitions and thereby provide insight into RNA dynamics and function at atomic resolution. Riboswitches are found in the 5\^{a}²-UTR of mRNA and control gene expression through structural transitions after ligand recognition. A time-resolved NMR strategy was established in conjunction with laser-triggered release of the ligand from a photocaged derivative to monitor the hypoxanthine-induced folding of the guanine-sensing riboswitch aptamer domain of the operon at atomic resolution. Combining selective isotope labeling of the RNA with NMR filter techniques resulted in significant spectral resolution and allowed kinetic analysis of the buildup rates for individual nucleotides in real time. Three distinct kinetic steps associated with the ligand-induced folding were delineated. After initial complex encounter the ligand-binding pocket is formed and results in subsequent stabilization of a remote long-range loop\^{a}loop interaction. Incorporation of NMR data into experimentally restrained molecular dynamics simulations provided insight into the RNA structural ensembles involved during the conformational transition.}},

Previous kinetics studies have revealed an early folding intermediate for T4 lysozyme, a small, well-characterized protein composed of an N-terminal and a C-terminal subdomain. Pulse-labeling hydrogen exchange studies suggest that residues from both subdomains contribute to the structure of this intermediate. On the other hand, equilibrium native state hydrogen experiments have revealed a high-energy, partially unfolded form of the protein that has an unstructured N-terminal subdomain and a structured C-terminal subdomain. To resolve this discrepancy between kinetics and equilibrium data, we performed detailed kinetics analyses of the folding and unfolding pathways of T4 lysozyme, as well as several point mutants and large-scale variants. The data support the argument for the presence of two distinct intermediates, one present on each side of the rate-limiting transition state barrier. The effects of circular permutation and site-specific mutations in the wild-type and circular permutant background, as well as a fragment containing just the C-terminal subdomain, support a model for the unfolding intermediate with an unfolded N-terminal and a folded C-terminal subdomain. Our results suggest that the partially unfolded form identified by native state hydrogen exchange resides on the folded side of the rate-limiting transition state and is, therefore, under most conditions, a '' hidden'' intermediate.}},

To eliminate the heme\^{a}ligand exchange chemistry that complicates and slows the folding kinetics by trapping misfolded structures, measurements were made with the imidazole complex. Fluorescence quenching due to excitation energy transfer from the tryptophan to the heme was used to monitor the distance between these groups. The fluorescence decrease is biphasic. There is an unresolved process with \"{I} < 50 \^{I}¼s, followed by a slower, exponential process with \"{I} = 600 \^{I}¼s at the lowest denaturant concentration (0.2 M guanidine hydrochloride). These kinetics are interpreted as a barrier-free, partial collapse to the new equilibrium unfolded state at the lower denaturant concentration, followed by slower crossing of a free energy barrier separating the unfolded and folded states. The results raise several fundamental issues concerning the dynamics of collapse and barrier crossings in protein folding.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In this article, time correlation function methods are used to discuss classical isomerization reactions of small nonrigid molecules in liquid solvents. Molecular expressions are derived for a macroscopic phenomenological rate constant. The form of several of these equations depend upon what ensemble is used when performing averages over initial conditions. All of these formulas, however, reduce to one final physical expression whose value is manifestly independent of ensemble. The validity of the physical expression hinges on a separation of time scales and the plateau value problem. The approximations needed to obtain transition state theory are described and the errors involved are estimated. The coupling of the reaction coordinate to the liquid medium provides the dissipation necessary for the existence of a plateau value for the rate constant, but it also leads to failures of Wigner's fundamental assumption for transition state theory. We predict that for many isomerization reactions, the transmission coefficient will differ significantly from unity and that the difference will be a strong function of the thermodynamic state of the liquid solvent.}},

  Abstract                 = {To meet the challenge of modeling the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules over long time scales, much recent effort has been devoted to constructing stochastic kinetic models, often in the form of discrete-state Markov models, from short molecular dynamics simulations. To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose configuration space into a set of kinetically metastable states. Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of conformational clustering techniques which assume that conformationally distinct clusters are also kinetically distinct. Here, we present a first version of an automatic algorithm for the discovery of kinetically metastable states that is generally applicable to solvated macromolecules. Given molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a well-defined starting distribution, the algorithm discovers long lived, kinetically metastable states through successive iterations of partitioning and aggregating conformation space into kinetically related regions. The authors apply this method to three peptides in explicit solvent-terminally blocked alanine, the 21-residue helical F(s) peptide, and the engineered 12-residue beta-hairpin trpzip2-to assess its ability to generate physically meaningful states and faithful kinetic models.},

  Abstract                 = {{Transition paths are a uniquely single-molecule property not yet observed for any molecular process in solution. The duration of transition paths is the tiny fraction of the time in an equilibrium single-molecule trajectory when the process actually happens. Here, we report the determination of an upper bound for the transition path time for protein folding from photon-by-photon trajectories. FRET trajectories were measured on single molecules of the dye-labeled, 56-residue 2-state protein GB1, immobilized on a glass surface via a biotin-streptavidin-biotin linkage. Characterization of individual emitted photons by their wavelength, polarization, and absolute and relative time of arrival after picosecond excitation allowed the determination of distributions of FRET efficiencies, donor and acceptor lifetimes, steady state polarizations, and waiting times in the folded and unfolded states. Comparison with the results for freely diffusing molecules showed that immobilization has no detectable effect on the structure or dynamics of the unfolded protein and only a small effect on the folding/unfolding kinetics. Analysis of the photon-by-photon trajectories yields a transition path time <200 μs, >10,000 times shorter than the mean waiting time in the unfolded state (the inverse of the folding rate coefficient). Szabo's theory for diffusive transition paths shows that this upper bound for the transition path time is consistent with previous estimates of the Kramers preexponential factor for the rate coefficient, and predicts that the transition path time is remarkably insensitive to the folding rate, with only a 2-fold difference for rate coefficients that differ by 105-fold.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A variational approach to the estimation of generators for Markov jump processes from discretely sampled data is discussed and generalized. In this approach, one first calculates the spectrum of the discrete maximum likelihood estimator for the transition matrix consistent with the discrete data. Then the generator that best matches the spectrum is determined by solving a convex quadratic minimization problem with linear constraints (quadratic program). Here, we discuss the method in detail and position it in the context of maximum likelihood inference of generators from discretely sampled data. Furthermore, we show how the approach can be generalized to estimation from data sampled at nonconstant time intervals. Finally, we discuss numerical aspects of the algorithm for estimation of processes with high-dimensional state spaces. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ Amide backbone and sidechain mutagenesis data can be used in combination with kinetic and thermodynamic measurements to understand the energetic contributions of backbone hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect to the acquisition of β-sheet structure. For example, it has been revealed that loop 1 of the WW domain forms in the transition state, consistent with the emerging theme that reverse turn formation is rate limiting in β-sheet folding. A distinct subset of WW domain residues principally influences thermodynamic stability by forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the native state. Energetic data and sequence mining reveal that only a small subset of the molecular information contained in sequences or observed in high-resolution structures is required to generate folded functional β-sheets, consistent with evolutionary robustness. }},

  Abstract                 = {{Backbone hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) are prominent features of protein structures; however, their role in protein folding remains controversial because they cannot be selectively perturbed by traditional methods of protein mutagenesis1, 2, 3. Here we have assessed the contribution of backbone H-bonds to the folding kinetics and thermodynamics of the PIN WW domain, a small -sheet protein4, by individually replacing its backbone amides with esters. Amide-to-ester mutations site-specifically perturb backbone H-bonds in two ways: a H-bond donor is eliminated by replacing an amide NH with an ester oxygen, and a H-bond acceptor is weakened by replacing an amide carbonyl with an ester carbonyl5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. We perturbed the 11 backbone H-bonds of the PIN WW domain by synthesizing 19 amide-to-ester mutants. Thermodynamic studies on these variants show that the protein is most destabilized when H-bonds that are enveloped by a hydrophobic cluster are perturbed. Kinetic studies indicate that native-like secondary structure forms in one of the protein's loops in the folding transition state, but the backbone is less ordered elsewhere in the sequence. Collectively, our results provide an unusually detailed picture of the folding of a -sheet protein.}},

For a generic bulk system of rods we identify a reduction of short-range repulsions as the origin of a negative osmotic coefficient. The counterions show signs of a weak three-dimensional order in the attractive regime only once the rod-imposed charge inhomogeneities are divided out. We also treat the case of attraction between a single pair of rods for a few selected line charge densities and rod radii. Measurements of the individual contributions to the force between close rods are studied as a function of Bjerrum length. We find that even though the total force is always attractive at sufficiently high Bjerrum length, the electrostatic contribution can ultimately become repulsive. We also measure azimuthal and longitudinal correlation functions to answer the question how condensed ions are distributed with respect to each other and to the neighboring rod. For instance, we show that the prevalent image of mutually interlocked ions is qualitatively correct, even though modifications due to thermal fluctuations are usually strong.}},

In the polymer perspective, the folding code is more a solvation code than a code of local phipsi propensities. The polymer perspective resolves two classic puzzles: (1) the Blind Watchmaker's Paradox that biological proteins could not have originated from random sequences, and (2) Levinthal's Paradox that the folded state of a protein cannot be found by random search. Both paradoxes are traditionally framed in terms of random unguided searches through vast spaces, and vastness is equated with impossibility. But both processes are partly guided. The searches are more akin to balls rolling down funnels than balls rolling aimlessly on flat surfaces. In both cases, the vastness of the search is largely irrelevant to the search time and success. These ideas are captured by energy and fitness landscapes. Energy landscapes give a language for bridging between microscopics and macroscopics, for relating folding kinetics to equilibrium fluctuations, and for developing new and faster computational search strategies.}},

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Polyprolines are well known for adopting a regular polyproline type II helix in aqueous solution, rendering them a popular standard as molecular ruler in structural molecular biology. However, single-molecule spectroscopy studies based on F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have revealed deviations of experimentally observed end-to-end distances of polyprolines from theoretical predictions, and it was proposed that the discrepancy resulted from dynamic flexibility of the polyproline helix. Here, we probe end-to-end distances and conformational dynamics of poly-l-prolines with 1--10 residues using fluorescence quenching by photoinduced-electron transfer (PET). A single fluorophore and a tryptophan residue, introduced at the termini of polyproline peptides, serve as sensitive probes for distance changes on the subnanometer length scale. Using a combination of ensemble fluorescence and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we demonstrate that polyproline samples exhibit static structural heterogeneity with subpopulations of distinct end-to-end distances that do not interconvert on time scales from nano- to milliseconds. By observing prolyl isomerization through changes in PET quenching interactions, we provide experimental evidence that the observed heterogeneity can be explained by interspersed cis isomers. Computer simulations elucidate the influence of trans/cis isomerization on polyproline structures in terms of end-to-end distance and provide a structural justification for the experimentally observed effects. Our results demonstrate that structural heterogeneity inherent in polyprolines, which to date are commonly applied as a molecular ruler, disqualifies them as appropriate tool for an accurate determination of absolute distances at a molecular scale.}},

Photoinduced electron transfer can be used to monitor structural variations with single-molecule sensitivity on sub-nanometre length scales and with nanosecond temporal resolution (see figure).Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between organic fluorophores and suitable electron donating moieties, for example, the amino acid tryptophan or the nucleobase guanine, can quench fluorescence upon van der Waals contact and thus report on molecular contact. PET-quenching has been used as reporter for monitoring conformational dynamics in polypeptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides. Whereas dynamic quenching transiently influences quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore, static quenching in pi-stacked complexes efficiently suppresses fluorescence emission over time scales longer than the fluorescence lifetime. Static quenching therefore provides sufficient contrast to be observed at the single-molecule level. Here, we review complex formation and static quenching of different fluorophores by various molecular compounds, discuss applications as reporter system for macromolecular dynamics, and give illustrating examples.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Understanding fluorescence quenching processes of organic dyes by biomolecular compounds is of fundamental importance for in-vitro and in-vivo fluorescence studies. It has been reported that the excited singlet state of some oxazine and rhodamine derivatives is efficiently and almost exclusively quenched by the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) and the DNA base guanine via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). We present a detailed analysis of the quenching interactions between the oxazine dye MR121 and Trp in aqueous buffer. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, together with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), reveal three contributing quenching mechanisms: 1) diffusion-limited dynamic quenching with a bimolecular quenching rate constant k(d) of 4.0 x 10(9) s(-1) M(-1), 2) static quenching with a bimolecular association constant K(s) of 61 M(-1), and 3) a sphere-of-action contribution to static quenching described by an exponential factor with a quenching constant lambda of 22 M(-1). The latter two are characterized as nonfluorescent complexes, formed with approximately 30 \% efficiency upon encounter, that are stable for tens of nanoseconds. The measured binding energy of 20-30 kJ mol(-1) is consistent with previous estimates from molecular dynamics simulations that proposed stacked complexes due to hydrophobic forces. We further evaluate the influence of glycerol and denaturant (guanidine hydrochloride) on the formation and stability of quenched complexes. Comparative measurements performed with two other dyes, ATTO 655 and Rhodamine 6G show similar results and thus demonstrate the general applicability of utilizing PET between organic dyes and Trp for the study of conformational dynamics of biopolymers on sub-nanometer length and nanosecond time-scales.}},

As a practical implementation of this concept, we define the transmission coefficient for any conformation to be the probability for a chain with the given conformation to fold before it unfolds. Since the transmission coefficient can serve as the best possible measure of kinetic distance for a system, we present two methods by which we can determine how closely any parameter of the system approximates the transmission coefficient. As we determine that the transmission coefficient for a short-chain heteropolymer system is dominated by entropic factors, we have chosen to illustrate the methods mentioned by applying them to geometrical properties of the system such as the number of native contacts and the looplength distribution. We find that these coordinates are not good approximations of the transmission coefficient and therefore, cannot adequately describe the kinetics of protein folding. {\copyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.}},

We validated the method by fluorescence-detected refolding of a genetically engineered lambda repressor mutant from its pressure-denatured state. We resolved barrierless structure formation upon return to ambient pressure; we observed a 2.1 0.7 microsecond refolding time, which is very close to the 'speed limit' for proteins and much faster than the corresponding temperature-jump refolding of the same protein. The ability to experimentally perform a large and very fast pressure drop opens up a new region of the biomolecular energy landscape for atomic-level simulation.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A unique feature of chemical catalysis mediated by enzymes is that the catalytically reactive atoms are embedded within a folded protein. Although current understanding of enzyme function has been focused on the chemical reactions and static three-dimensional structures, the dynamic nature of proteins has been proposed to have a function in catalysis1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The concept of conformational substates has been described6; however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein flexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis--trans isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with NMR relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously3, 7, 8, 9, 10, we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of CypA. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The kinetics of protein folding for horse ferricytochrome c was investigated by stopped-flow methods, using far-UV circular dichroism (CD), near-UV CD, and tryptophan fluorescence to probe the formation of secondary structure and tertiary interactions. In the far-UV region of the CD spectrum (222 nm), 44\% of the total change associated with refolding occurs within the dead time of the stopped-flow experiment, indicating that a significant amount of helical secondary structure is formed in less than 4 ms. The remaining changes in the ellipticity at 222 nm occur in two kinetic phases with time constants of about 40 ms and 0.7 s, respectively. In contrast, there is no evidence for rapid changes in the ellipticity at 289 nm: an aromatic CD band, which is indicative of the formation of a tightly packed core, only begins to appear in a 400-ms step and is completed in a final 10-s phase. The fluorescence of a single tryptophan at position 59, which becomes quenched upon folding via nonradiative energy transfer to the heme group, provides complementary information on the condensation of the polypeptide chain during refolding. The fluorescence-detected stopped-flow folding kinetics of ferricytochrome c exhibits a 35\% decrease in fluorescence during the dead time, suggesting that a substantial decrease in the average tryptophan-heme distance occurs on a submillisecond time scale. The subsequent fluorescence changes exhibit two prominent phases with time constants of about 20 and 300 ms, followed by a minor 5-s phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper is concerned with the Bayesian estimation of nonlinear stochastic differential equations when observations are discretely sampled. The estimation framework relies on the introduction of latent auxiliary data to complete the missing diffusion between each pair of measurements. Tuned Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in conjunction with the Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme, are used to sample the posterior distribution of the latent data and the model parameters. Techniques for computing the likelihood function, the marginal likelihood, and diagnostic measures (all based on the MCMC output) are developed. Examples using simulated and real data are presented and discussed in detail.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We have performed molecular dynamics simulations on a set of nine unfolded conformations of the fastest-folding protein yet discovered, a variant of the villin headpiece subdomain (HP-35 NleNle). The simulations were generated using a new distributed computing method, yielding hundreds of trajectories each on a time scale comparable to the experimental folding time, despite the large (10,000 atom) size of the simulation system. This strategy eliminates the need to assume a two-state kinetic model or to build a Markov state model. The relaxation to the folded state at 300 K from the unfolded configurations (generated by simulation at 373 K) was monitored by a method intended to reflect the experimental observable (quenching of tryptophan by histidine). We also monitored the relaxation to the native state by directly comparing structural snapshots with the native state. The rate of relaxation to the native state and the number of resolvable kinetic time scales both depend upon starting structure. Moreover, starting structures with folding rates most similar to experiment show some native-like structure in the N-terminal helix (helix 1) and the phenylalanine residues constituting the hydrophobic core, suggesting that these elements may exist in the experimentally relevant unfolded state. Our large-scale simulation data reveal kinetic complexity not resolved in the experimental data. Based on these findings, we propose additional experiments to further probe the kinetics of villin folding.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We present an advanced time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique that delivers traditional fluorescence correlation (FCS) or cross correlation (FCCS) and fluorescence lifetime data simultaneously. Newly developed electronics allow for detection and registration of single photon events over time periods of hours with picoseconds accuracy. Subsequent software-correlation yields correlation curves covering more than 12 orders of magnitude in time. At the same time, the original data, containing all information accessible by single photon counting techniques, can be analyzed conventionally according to common single molecule fluorescence techniques. Potential applications of the new technique using pulsed or cw laser excitation are discussed.}},

The intermediate has the N-terminal helix and a part of the C-terminal helix unfolded. In earlier studies, we also solved the structures of two other folding intermediates for the same protein: one with the N-terminal helix alone unfolded and the other with a reorganized hydrophobic core. Together, these structures provide a description of a protein folding pathway with multiple intermediates at atomic resolution. The two general features for the intermediates are (i) native-like backbone topology and (ii) nonnative side-chain interactions. These results have implications for important issues in protein folding studies, including large-scale conformation search, -value analysis, and computer simulations.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Protein folding is a grand challenge of the postgenomic era. In this paper, 58 folding events sampled during 47 molecular dynamics trajectories for a total simulation time of more than 4 μs provide an atomic detail picture of the folding of a 20-residue synthetic peptide with a stable three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet fold. The simulations successfully reproduce the NMR solution conformation, irrespective of the starting structure. The sampling of the conformational space is sufficient to determine the free energy surface and localize the minima and transition states. The statistically predominant folding pathway involves the formation of contacts between strands 2 and 3, starting with the side chains close to the turn, followed by association of the N-terminal strand onto the preformed 2--3 β-hairpin. The folding mechanism presented here, formation of a β-hairpin followed by consolidation, is in agreement with a computational study of the free energy surface of another synthetic three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet by Bursulaya and Brooks [(1999) 121, 9947--9951]. Hence, it might hold in general for antiparallel β-sheets with short turns.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1073/pnas.182542699 There are proposals to overcome the current incompatibilities between the time scales of protein folding and molecular dynamics simulation by using a large number of short simulations of only tens of nanoseconds (distributed computing). According to the principles of first-order kinetic processes, a sufficiently large number of short simulations will include, , a small number of long time scale events that have proceeded to completion. But protein folding is not an elementary kinetic step: folding has a series of early conformational steps that lead to lag phases at the beginning of the kinetics. The presence of these lag phases can bias short simulations toward selecting minor pathways that have fewer or faster lag steps and so miss the major folding pathways. Attempts to circumvent the lags by using loosely coupled parallel simulations that search for first-order transitions are also problematic because of the difficulty of detecting transitions in molecular dynamics simulations. Nevertheless, the procedure of using parallel independent simulations is perfectly valid and quite feasible once the time scale of simulation proceeds past the lag phases into a single exponential region.}},

The ongoing study of protein folding through computational methods thus requires both improvements in the performance of molecular dynamics programs to make longer timescales accessible, and testing of force fields in the context of folding simulations. We report a ten-microsecond simulation of an incipient downhill-folding WW domain mutant along with measurement of a molecular time and activated folding time of 1.5 microseconds and 13.3 microseconds, respectively. The protein simulated in explicit solvent exhibits several metastable states with incorrect topology and does not assume the native state during the present simulations. 10.1529/biophysj.108.131565}},

To help understanding the mechanism of nucleosome opening and closing in these processes, we studied the disassembly of mononucleosomes by quantitative single-molecule FRET with high spatial resolution, using the SELEX-generated '' Widom 601'' positioning sequence labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores. Reversible dissociation was induced by increasing NaCl concentration. At least 3 species with different FRET were identified and assigned to structures: () the most stable high-FRET species corresponding to the intact nucleosome, () a less stable mid-FRET species that we attribute to a first intermediate with a partially unwrapped DNA and less histones, and () a low-FRET species characterized by a very broad FRET distribution, representing highly unwrapped structures and free DNA formed at the expense of the other 2 species. Selective FCS analysis indicates that even in the low-FRET state, some histones are still bound to the DNA. The interdye distance of 54.0 \r{A} measured for the high-FRET species corresponds to a compact conformation close to the known crystallographic structure. The coexistence and interconversion of these species is first demonstrated under non-invasive conditions. A geometric model of the DNA unwinding predicts the presence of the observed FRET species. The different structures of these species in the disassembly pathway map the energy landscape indicating major barriers for 10-bp and minor ones for 5-bp DNA unwinding steps.}},

Here, we directly extract the full free energy landscape of a single molecule of the GCN4 leucine zipper using dual beam optical tweezers. To this end, we use deconvolution force spectroscopy to follow an individual molecule's trajectory with high temporal and spatial resolution. We find a heterogeneous energy landscape of the GCN4 leucine zipper domain. The energy profile is divided into two stable C-terminal heptad repeats and two less stable repeats at the N-terminus. Energies and transition barrier positions were confirmed by single molecule kinetic analysis. We anticipate that deconvolution sampling is a powerful tool for the model-free investigation of protein energy landscapes.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Absorbance changes in the infrared and visible spectral range were measured in parallel during the photocycle of light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin, which is accompanied by a vectorial proton transfer. A global fit analysis yielded the same rate constants for the chromophore reactions, for protonation changes of protein side groups, and for the backbone motion. From this result we conclude that all reactions in various parts of the protein are synchronized to each other and that no independent cycles exist for different parts. The carbonyl vibration of Asp-85, indicating its protonation, appears with the same rate constant as the Schiff base deprotonation. The carbonyl vibration of Asp-96 disappears, indicating most likely its deprotonation, with the same rate constant as for the Schiff base reprotonation. This result supports the proposed mechanism in which the protonated Schiff base, a deprotonated aspartic acid (Asp-85) on the proton-release pathway, and a protonated aspartic acid (Asp-96) on the proton-uptake pathway act as internal catalytic proton-binding sites.}},

Experimental evidence is presented for more than one such pathway in the folding dynamics of a globular protein, cytochrome c. After photodissociation of CO from the partially denatured ferrous protein, fast time-resolved CD spectroscopy shows a submillisecond folding process that is complete in approximately 10(-6) s, concomitant with heme binding of a methionine residue. Kinetic modeling of time-resolved magnetic circular dichroism data further provides strong evidence that a 50-microseconds heme-histidine binding process proceeds in parallel with the faster pathway, implying that Met and His binding occur in different conformational ensembles of the protein, i.e., along respective ultrafast (microseconds) and fast (milliseconds) folding pathways. This kinetic heterogeneity appears to be intrinsic to the diffusional nature of early folding dynamics on the energy landscape, as opposed to the late-time heterogeneity associated with nonnative heme ligation and proline isomers in cytochrome c.}},

We describe a simple and robust method to estimate the rates of transitions between different conformational states and the FRET efficiencies associated with these states. For a photon trajectory with measured interphoton times, the pattern of colors is decoded by maximizing the appropriate likelihood function. This approach can be used to analyze bursts of photons from diffusing molecules as well as photon trajectories generated by immobilized molecules. The procedure is illustrated using simulated photon trajectories corresponding to two-state and three-state molecules. The method works even when the photon colors appear to be scrambled because of high background noise, the photophysical properties of the conformers are similar, or the conformational and photon count rates are comparable. The consistency of the model with the data can be checked by recoloring the photon trajectories and comparing the predicted and observed FRET efficiency histograms.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Ewald and related methods are nowadays routinely used in explicit-solvent simulations of biomolecules, although they impose an artificial periodicity in systems which are inherently non-periodic. The consequences of this approximation should be assessed, since they may crucially affect the reliability of computer simulations under Ewald boundary conditions. In the present study we use a method based on continuum electrostatics to investigate the nature and magnitude of possible periodicity-induced artifacts on the potentials of mean force for conformational equilibria in biomolecules. Three model systems and pathways are considered: polyalanine oligopeptides (unfolding), a DNA tetranucleotide (separation of the strands), and the protein Sac7d (conformations from a molecular dynamics simulation). Artificial periodicity may significantly affect these conformational equilibria, in each case stabilizing the most compact conformation of the biomolecule. Three factors enhance periodicity-induced artifacts: (i) a solvent of low dielectric permittivity; (ii) a solute size which is non-negligible compared to the size of the unit cell; and (iii) a non-neutral solute. Neither the neutrality of the solute nor the absence of charge pairs at distances exceeding half the edge of the unit cell do guarantee the absence of artifacts.}},

We describe an implementation for Nvidia graphical processing units (GPUs) which are general purpose computing devices with a high degree of intrinsic parallelism and arithmetic performance. We find that, for typical biomolecular simulations (e.g., DHFR, 26K atoms), a single GPU equipped workstation is able to provide sufficient performance to permit simulation rates of ≈50 ns/day when used in conjunction with the ACEMD molecular dynamics package(1) and exhibits an accuracy comparable to that of a reference double-precision CPU implementation.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A systematic computational approach to describe the conformational dynamics of biomolecules in reduced dimensionality is presented. The method is based on (i) the decomposition of a high-dimensional molecular dynamics trajectory into a few '' system'' and (many) '' bath'' degrees of freedom and (ii) a Langevin simulation of the resulting model. Employing principal component analysis, the dimension of the system is chosen such that it contains all slow large-amplitude motions of the molecule, while the bath coordinates only account for its high-frequency fluctuations. It is shown that a sufficiently large dimension of the model is essential to ensure a clear time scale separation of system and bath variables, which warrants the validity of the memory-free Langevin equation. Applying methods from nonlinear time series analysis, a practical Langevin algorithm is presented which performs a local estimation of the multidimensional Langevin vector fields describing deterministic drift and stochastic driving. Adopting a 800 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the folding of heptaalanine in explicit water, it is shown that a five-dimensional Langevin model correctly reproduces the structure and conformational dynamics of the system. The virtues and limits of the approach are discussed in some detail.}},

Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The spontaneous dissociation of six small ligands from the active site of FKBP (the FK506 binding protein) is investigated by explicit water molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis. The ligands have between four (dimethylsulphoxide) and eleven (5-diethylamino-2-pentanone) non-hydrogen atoms, and an affinity for FKBP ranging from 20 to 0.2 mM. The conformations of the FKBP/ligand complex saved along multiple trajectories (50 runs at 310 K for each ligand) are grouped according to a set of intermolecular distances into nodes of a network, and the direct transitions between them are the links. The network analysis reveals that the bound state consists of several subbasins, i.e., binding modes characterized by distinct intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. The dissociation kinetics show a simple (i.e., single-exponential) time dependence because the unbinding barrier is much higher than the barriers between subbasins in the bound state. The unbinding transition state is made up of heterogeneous positions and orientations of the ligand in the FKBP active site, which correspond to multiple pathways of dissociation. For the six small ligands of FKBP, the weaker the binding affinity the closer to the bound state (along the intermolecular distance) are the transition state structures, which is a new manifestation of Hammond behavior. Experimental approaches to the study of fragment binding to proteins have limitations in temporal and spatial resolution. Our network analysis of the unbinding simulations of small inhibitors from an enzyme paints a clear picture of the free energy landscape (both thermodynamics and kinetics) of ligand unbinding. Most known drugs used to fight human diseases are small molecules that bind strongly to proteins, particularly to enzymes or receptors involved in essential biochemical or physiological processes. The binding process is very complex because of the many degrees of freedom and multiple interactions between pairs of atoms. Here we show that network analysis, a mathematical tool used to study a plethora of complex systems ranging from social interactions (e.g, friendship links in Facebook) to metabolic networks, provides a detailed description of the free energy landscape and pathways involved in the binding of small molecules to an enzyme. Using molecular dynamics simulations to sample the free energy landscape, we provide strong evidence at atomistic detail that small ligands can have multiple favorable positions and orientations in the active site. We also observe a broad heterogeneity of (un)binding pathways. Experimental approaches to the study of fragment binding to proteins have limitations in spatial and temporal resolution. Our network analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations does not suffer from these limitations. It provides a thorough description of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the binding process.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Simulating the conformational dynamics of biomolecules is extremely difficult due to the rugged nature of their free energy landscapes and multiple long-lived, or metastable, states. Generalized ensemble (GE) algorithms, which have become popular in recent years, attempt to facilitate crossing between states at low temperatures by inducing a random walk in temperature space. Enthalpic barriers may be crossed more easily at high temperatures; however, entropic barriers will become more significant. This poses a problem because the dominant barriers to conformational change are entropic for many biological systems, such as the short RNA hairpin studied here. We present a new efficient algorithm for conformational sampling, called the adaptive seeding method (ASM), which uses nonequilibrium GE simulations to identify the metastable states, and seeds short simulations at constant temperature from each of them to quantitatively determine their equilibrium populations. Thus, the ASM takes advantage of the broad sampling possible with GE algorithms but generally crosses entropic barriers more efficiently during the seeding simulations at low temperature. We show that only local equilibrium is necessary for ASM, so very short seeding simulations may be used. Moreover, the ASM may be used to recover equilibrium properties from existing datasets that failed to converge, and is well suited to running on modern computer clusters.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A structurally conserved element, the trigger loop, has been suggested to play a key role in substrate selection and catalysis of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription elongation. Recently resolved X-ray structures showed that the trigger loop forms direct interactions with the β-phosphate and base of the matched nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) through residues His1085 and Leu1081, respectively. In order to understand the role of these two critical residues in stabilizing active site conformation in the dynamic complex, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type pol II elongation complex and its mutants in explicit solvent. In the wild-type complex, we found that the trigger loop is stabilized in the '' closed'' conformation, and His1085 forms a stable interaction with the NTP. Simulations of point mutations of His1085 are shown to affect this interaction; simulations of alternative protonation states, which are inaccessible through experiment, indicate that only the protonated form is able to stabilize the His1085-NTP interaction. Another trigger loop residue, Leu1081, stabilizes the incoming nucleotide position through interaction with the nucleotide base. Our simulations of this Leu mutant suggest a three-component mechanism for correctly positioning the incoming NTP in which (i) hydrophobic contact through Leu1081, (ii) base stacking, and (iii) base pairing work together to minimize the motion of the incoming NTP base. These results complement experimental observations and provide insight into the role of the trigger loop on transcription fidelity.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1073/pnas.0605580103 It has long been known that a protein's amino acid sequence dictates its native structure. However, despite significant recent advances, an ensemble description of how a protein achieves its native conformation from random coil under physiologically relevant conditions remains incomplete. Here we present a detailed all-atom model with a transferable potential that is capable of folding of entire protein domains using only sequence information. The computational efficiency of this model allows us to perform thousands of microsecond-time scale-folding simulations of the engrailed homeodomain and to observe thousands of complete independent folding events. We apply a graph-theoretic analysis to this massive data set to elucidate which intermediates and intermediary states are common to many trajectories and thus important for the folding process. This method provides an atomically detailed and complete picture of a folding pathway at the ensemble level. The approach that we describe is quite general and could be used to study the folding of proteins on time scales orders of magnitude longer than currently possible.}},

  Abstract                 = {{PMID: 11804484 A fluorescent amino acid derivative (Fmoc-DBO) has been synthesized, which contains 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO) as a small, hydrophilic fluorophore with an extremely long fluorescence lifetime (325 ns in H2O and 505 ns in D2O under air). Polypeptides containing both the DBO residue and an efficient fluorescence quencher allow the measurement of rate constants for intramolecular end-to-end contact formation. Bimolecular quenching experiments indicated that Trp, Cys, Met, and Tyr are efficient quenchers of DBO (kq = 20, 5.1, 4.5, and 3.6 108 M-1 s-1 in D2O), while the other amino acids are inefficient. The quenching by Trp, which was selected as an intrinsic quencher, is presumed to involve exciplex-induced deactivation. Flexible, structureless polypeptides, Trp-(Gly-Ser)n-DBO-NH2, were prepared by standard solid-phase synthesis, and the rates of contact formation were measured through the intramolecular fluorescence quenching of DBO by Trp with time-correlated single-photon counting, laser flash photolysis, and steady-state fluorometry. Rate constants of 4.1, 6.8, 4.9, 3.1, 2.0, and 1.1 107 s-1 for n = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 were obtained. Noteworthy was the relatively slow quenching for the shortest peptide (n = 0). The kinetic data are in agreement with recent transient absorption studies of triplet probes for related peptides, but the rate constants are significantly larger. In contrast to the flexible structureless Gly-Ser polypeptides, the polyproline Trp-Pro4-DBO-NH2 showed insignificant fluorescence quenching, suggesting that a high polypeptide flexibility and the possibility of probequencher contact is essential to induce quenching. Advantages of the new fluorescence-based method for measuring contact formation rates in biopolymers include high accuracy, fast time range (100 ps1 mus), and the possibility to perform measurements in water under air.}},

  Abstract                 = {{
 Confinement of matter on the nanometre scale can induce phase transitions not seen in bulk systems. In the case of water, so-called drying transitions occur on this scale as a result of strong hydrogen-bonding between water molecules, which can cause the liquid to recede from nonpolar surfaces to form a vapour layer separating the bulk phase from the surface. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous filling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a one-dimensionally ordered chain of water molecules. Although the molecules forming the chain are in chemical and thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath, we observe pulse-like transmission of water through the nanotube. These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that density fluctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis. We also find that a minute reduction in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and filled states on a nanosecond timescale. These observations suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their rigid nonpolar structures, might be exploited as unique molecular channels for water and protons, with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by changes in the local channel polarity and solvent conditions.

  Abstract                 = {{PMID: 19678693 Endonucleases, such as the restriction enzyme EcoRV, cleave the DNA backbone at a specific recognition sequence. We have investigated the catalytic mechanism of backbone phosphodiester hydrolysis by the restriction enzyme EcoRV by means of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations. An exhaustive computation of different reaction pathways is performed, thus generating a network of pathways. Comparison of the computed (AM1d/MM) enzymatic reaction pathways with an analogous mechanism for small-molecule model systems [AM1/d and B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p)] reveals that the transition barriers for associative hydrolysis, which is more probable in the model systems, are not lowered by the enzyme. Instead, a reaction mechanism which has mostly dissociative character is more likely. The protein environment is tuned to significantly electrostatically stabilize the transition state structures. The direct catalytic impact of essential residues is determined: The magnesium metal ion activates a water molecule, thus facilitating protonation of the leaving group. A reduction of the coordination number of the magnesium metal ion from six to four upon the positioning of the attacking water molecule explains why larger metal ions, such as calcium, are not catalytically active. The nucleophile is generated by the transfer of a proton from the attacking water molecule to a carboxylic oxygen atom of aspartate 90. The catalytic effect of lysine 92 involves proper positioning of the scissile phosphate group and, more importantly, stabilization of the metaphosphate intermediate in an orientation optimal for attack of the nucleophile.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the Pin WW domain, a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, have been characterized extensively. Folding and activation free energies were determined as a function of temperature for 16 mutants, which sample all strands and turns of the molecule. The mutational phi value (Φ m ) diagram is a smooth function of sequence, indicating a prevalence of local interactions in the transition state (TS). At 37 $\,^{\circ}$C, the diagram has a single pronounced maximum at turn 1: the rate-limiting step during folding is the formation of loop 1. In contrast, key residues for thermodynamic stability are located in the strand hydrophobic clusters, indicating that factors contributing to protein stability and folding kinetics are not correlated. The location of the TS along the entropic reaction coordinate Φ T , obtained by temperature-tuning the kinetics, reveals that sufficiently destabilizing mutants in loop 2 or in the Leu7-Trp11-Tyr24-Pro37 hydrophobic cluster can cause a switch to a late TS. Φ m analysis is usually applied '' perturbatively'' (methyl truncation), but with Φ T to quantitatively assess TS shifts along a reaction coordinate, more severe mutations can be used to probe regions of the free energy surface beyond the TS.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1073/pnas.0605504103 Globular proteins fold by minimizing the nonpolar surface that is exposed to water, while simultaneously providing hydrogen-bonding interactions for buried backbone groups, usually in the form of secondary structures such as α-helices, β-sheets, and tight turns. A primary thermodynamic driving force for the formation of globular structure is thus the sequestration of nonpolar groups, but the correlation between the parts of proteins that are observed to fold first (termed folding initiation sites) and the '' hydrophobicity'' (as customarily defined) of the amino acids in these regions has been quite weak. It has previously been noted that many amino acid side chains contain considerable nonpolar sections, even if they also contain polar or charged groups. For example, a lysine side chain contains four methylenes, which may undergo hydrophobic interactions if the charged ε-NH group is salt-bridged or hydrogen-bonded. Folding initiation sites might therefore contain not only accepted '' hydrophobic'' amino acids, but also larger charged side chains. Recent experiments on the folding of mutant apomyoglobins provides corroboration for models based on the hypothesis that folding initiation sites arise from hydrophobic interactions. A near-perfect correlation was observed between the areas of the molecule that are present in the burst-phase kinetic intermediate and both the free energy of formation of hydrophobic initiation sites and the parameter '' average area buried upon folding,'' which pinpoints large side chains, even those containing charged or polar portions. These results provide a putative mechanism for the control of protein-folding initiation and growth by polar/nonpolar sequence propensity alone.}},

Among the current arsenal, SM fluorescence techniques have capabilities of probing the dynamic interactions of nucleic acids and proteins via F\"{o}rster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET), tracking single particles over microns of distances, and deciphering the rotational motion of multisubunit systems. In this exciting era of transitioning from in vitro to in vivo and in situ conditions, it is anticipated that SM fluorescence methodology will become a common tool of molecular biology.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The identification of metastable states of a molecule plays an important role in the interpretation of molecular simulation data because the free-energy surface, the relative populations in this landscape, and ultimately also the dynamics of the molecule under study can be described in terms of these states. We compare the results of three different geometric cluster algorithms (neighbor algorithm, K-medoids algorithm, and common-nearest-neighbor algorithm) among each other and to the results of a kinetic cluster algorithm. First, we demonstrate the characteristics of each of the geometric cluster algorithms using five two-dimensional data sets. Second, we analyze the molecular dynamics data of a beta-heptapeptide in methanol--a molecule that exhibits a distinct folded state, a structurally diverse unfolded state, and a fast folding/unfolding equilibrium--using both geometric and kinetic cluster algorithms. We find that geometric clustering strongly depends on the algorithm used and that the density based common-nearest-neighbor algorithm is the most robust of the three geometric cluster algorithms with respect to variations in the input parameters and the distance metric. When comparing the geometric cluster results to the metastable states of the beta-heptapeptide as identified by kinetic clustering, we find that in most cases the folded state is identified correctly but the overlap of geometric clusters with further metastable states is often at best approximate.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1073/pnas.032077799 Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) of fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) on immobilized individual fluorophores was used to study the Mg-facilitated conformational change of an RNA three-helix junction, a structural element that initiates the folding of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Transitions of the RNA junction between open and folded conformations resulted in fluctuations in fluorescence by FRET. Fluorescence fluctuations occurring between two FRET states on the millisecond time scale were found to be dependent on Mg and Na concentrations. Correlation functions of the fluctuations were used to determine transition rates between the two conformations as a function of Mg or Na concentration. Both the opening and folding rates were found to vary with changing salt conditions. Assuming specific binding of divalent ions to RNA, the Mg dependence of the observed rates cannot be explained by conformational change induced by Mg binding/unbinding, but is consistent with a model in which the intrinsic conformational change of the RNA junction is altered by uptake of Mg ion(s). This version of FCS/FRET on immobilized single molecules is demonstrated to be a powerful technique in the study of conformational dynamics of biomolecules over time scales ranging from microseconds to seconds.}},

Direct information about diffusion and interaction of GPCRs and their G-proteins is mandatory for an understanding of the signal transduction mechanism. By using single-particle tracking, we show that the encounters of the α-subunit C-terminus with the GPCR rhodopsin change after receptor activation. Slow as well as less restricted diffusion compared to the inactive state within domains 60−280 nm in length was found for the receptor-bound C-terminus, indicating short-range order in rhodopsin packing.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Many biochemical processes proceed through the formation of functionally significant intermediates. Although the identification and characterization of such species can provide vital clues about the mechanisms of the reactions involved, it is challenging to obtain information of this type in cases where the intermediates are transient or present only at low population. One important example of such a situation involves the folding behaviour of small proteins that represents a model for the acquisition of functional structure in biology. Here we use relaxation dispersion nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify, for two mutational variants of one such protein, the SH3 domain from Fyn tyrosine kinase, a low-population folding intermediate in equilibrium with its unfolded and fully folded states. By performing the NMR experiments at different temperatures, this approach has enabled characterization of the kinetics and energetics of the folding process as well as providing structures of the intermediates. A general strategy emerges for an experimental determination of the energy landscape of a protein by applying this methodology to a series of mutants whose intermediates have differing degrees of native-like structure.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Summary. Recent advances in experimental technologies allow scientists to follow biochemical processes on a single-molecule basis, which provides much richer information about chemical dynamics than traditional ensemble-averaged experiments but also raises many new statistical challenges. The paper provides the first likelihood-based statistical analysis of the single-molecule fluorescence lifetime experiment designed to probe the conformational dynamics of a single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hairpin molecule. The conformational change is initially treated as a continuous time two-state Markov chain, which is not observable and must be inferred from changes in photon emissions. This model is further complicated by unobserved molecular Brownian diffusions. Beyond the simple two-state model, a competing model that models the energy barrier between the two states of the DNA hairpin as an Ornstein\&\#150;Uhlenbeck process has been suggested in the literature. We first derive the likelihood function of the simple two-state model and then generalize the method to handle complications such as unobserved molecular diffusions and the fluctuating energy barrier. The data augmentation technique and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are developed to sample from the posterior distribution desired. The Bayes factor calculation and posterior estimates of relevant parameters indicate that the fluctuating barrier model fits the data better than the simple two-state model.}},

Since the entanglement length Ne is found to be approximately 35, our chains cover the crossover from the nonentangled to the entangled regime. The Rouse model provides an excellent description for short chains N\&lt;Ne, while the dynamics of the long chains can be described by the reptation model. By mapping the model chains onto chemical species we give estimates of the times and distances of onset of the slowing down in motion due to reptation. Comparison to neutron spin‐echo data confirm our mapping procedure, resolving a discrepancy between various experiments. By considering the primitive chain we are able to directly visualize the confinement to a tube. Analyzing the Rouse mode relaxation allows us to exclude the generalized Rouse models, while the original reptation prediction gives a good description of the data.}},

First, the propagation of an ensemble of molecular states is described as a Markov chain by a transition probability matrix in a finite state space. Second, we obtain metastable conformations by an aggregation of variables via Robust Perron Cluster Analysis (PCCA+). Up to now, it has been an open question as to how this coarse graining in space can be transformed to a coarse graining of the Markov chain while preserving the essential dynamic information. In this article, we construct a coarse matrix that is the correct propagator in the space of conformations. This coarse graining procedure carries over to rate matrices and allows to extract transition rates between molecular conformations. This approach is based on the fact that PCCA+ computes molecular conformations as linear combinations of the dominant eigenvectors of the transition matrix.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Functionally relevant slow conformational motions of proteins are, at present, in most cases inaccessible to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The main reason is that the major part of the computational effort is spend for the accurate description of a huge number of high frequency motions of the protein and the surrounding solvent. The accumulated influence of these fluctuations is crucial for a correct treatment of the conformational dynamics; however, their details can be considered irrelevant for most purposes. To accurately describe long time protein dynamics we here propose a reduced dimension approach, collective Langevin dynamics (CLD), which evolves the dynamics of the system within a small subspace of relevant collective degrees of freedom. The dynamics within the low-dimensional conformational subspace is evolved via a generalized Langevin equation which accounts for memory effects via memory kernels also extracted from short explicit MD simulations. To determine the memory kernel with differing levels of regularization, we propose and evaluate two methods. As a first test, CLD is applied to describe the conformational motion of the peptide neurotensin. A drastic dimension reduction is achieved by considering one single curved conformational coordinate. CLD yielded accurate thermodynamical and dynamical behaviors. In particular, the rate of transitions between two conformational states agreed well with a rate obtained from a 150 ns reference molecular dynamics simulation, despite the fact that the time scale of the transition (\~{}50 ns) was much longer than the 1 ns molecular dynamics simulation from which the memory kernel was extracted.}},

To determine the length scale associated with this contact, tryptophan was embedded in a room-temperature glass containing a high concentration of cysteine. The decay of the triplet population is extended in time, consistent with a rate coefficient that decreases exponentially with distance. Solving the diffusion equation with this distant-dependent rate reproduces the observed bimolecular rates in water and shows that quenching at low viscosities takes place ≲1 {\AA} from van der Waals contact between the tryptophan and cysteine.}},

Here we describe a method for studying contact formation between tryptophan and cysteine based on measurements of the lifetime of the tryptophan triplet state. With tryptophan at one end of a flexible peptide and cysteine at the other, the triplet decay rate is identical to the rate of quenching by cysteine. We show that this rate is also close to the diffusion-limited rate of contact formation. The length dependence of this end-to-end contact rate was studied in a series of Cys-(Ala-Gly-Gln)k-Trp peptides, with k varying from 1 to 6. The rate decreases from ∼1/(40 ns) for k = 1 to ∼1/(140 ns) for k = 6, approaching the length dependence expected for a random coil (n−3/2) for the longest peptides.}},

To explore the folding landscape of villin headpiece subdomain HP35, we conducted two sets of replica exchange molecular dynamics for 200 ns each and three sets of conventional microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations, using AMBER FF03 force field and a generalized-Born solvation model. The protein folded consistently to the native state; the lowest C-rmsd from the x-ray structure was 0.46 \r{A}, and the C- rmsd of the center of the most populated cluster was 1.78 \r{A} at 300 K. simulations have previously not reached this level. The folding landscape of HP35 can be partitioned into the native, denatured, and two intermediate-state regions. The native state is separated from the major folding intermediate state by a small barrier, whereas a large barrier exists between the major folding intermediate and the denatured states. The melting temperature = 339 K extracted from the heat-capacity profile was in close agreement with the experimentally derived = 342 K. A comprehensive picture of the kinetics and thermodynamics of HP35 folding emerges when the results from replica exchange and conventional molecular dynamics simulations are combined.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Although the structures of native proteins are generally unique, the pathways by which they form are often free to vary. Some proteins fold by a multitude of different pathways, whereas others seem restricted to only one choice. An explanation for this variation in folding behaviour has recently emerged from studies of transition state changes: the number of accessible pathways is linked to the number of nucleation motifs contained within the native topology. We refer to these nucleation motifs as 'foldons', as they approach the size of an independent cooperative unit. Thus, with respect to pathway malleability and the composition of the folding funnel, proteins can be seen as modular assemblies of competing foldons. For the split beta-alpha-beta fold, these foldons are two-strand-helix motifs coupled by spatial overlap.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper describes the first experimental application of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, a new method for determining chemical kinetic constants and diffusion coefficients. These quantities are measured by observing the time behaviour of the tiny concentration fluctuations which occur spontaneously in the reaction system even when it is in equilibrium. The equilibrium of the system is not disturbed during the experiment. The diffusion coefficients and chemical rate constants which determine the average time behaviour of these spontaneous fluctuations are the same as those sought by more conventional methods including temperature-jump or other perturbation techniques. The experiment consists essentially in measuring the variation with time of the number of molecules of specified reactants in a defined open volume of solution. The concentration of a reactant is measured by its fluorescence; the sample volume is defined by a focused laser beam which excites the fluorescence. The fluorescent emission fluctuates in proportion with the changes in the number of fluorescent molecules as they diffuse into and out of the sample volume and as they are created or eliminated by the chemical reactions. The number of these reactant molecules must be small to permit detection of the concentration fluctuations. Hence the sample volume is small (10-8 ml) and the concentration of the solutes is low (sim 10-9 M). We have applied this technique to the study of two prototype systems: the simple example of pure diffusion of a single fluorescent species, rhodamine 6G, and the more interesting but more challenging example of the reaction of macromolecular DNA with the drug ethidium bromide to form a fluorescent complex. The increase of the fluorescence of the ethidium bromide upon formation of the complex permits the observation of the decay of concentration fluctuations via the chemical reaction and consequently the determination of chemical rate constants.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The folding of lysozyme involves parallel events in which hydrogen exchange kinetics indicate the development of persistent structure at very different rates. We have monitored directly the kinetics of formation of the native molecule by the binding of a fluorescently labelled inhibitor, MeU-diNAG (4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N'-diacetyl-beta-D-chitobioside). The data show that native character monitored in this way also develops with different timescales. Although the rate determining step on the slow pathway (approximately 75\% of molecules at pH 5.5, 20 degrees C) can be attributed to the need to reorganise structure formed early in the folding process, the data indicate that the rate determining step on the fast track (involving approximately 25\% of molecules) involves the docking of the two constituent domains of the protein. In the fast folding track the data are consistent with a model in which each domain forms persistent structure prior to their docking in a locally cooperative manner on a timescale comparable to the folding of small single domain proteins.}},

The unfolding rate constant was 1,100 s(-1) in water at 25 degrees C and 205,000 s(-1) at 63 degrees C. The unfolding half-life is extrapolated to be approximately 7.5 ns at 100 degrees C, which allows real-time molecular dynamics unfolding simulations to be tested on this system at a realistic temperature. Preliminary simulations did indeed conform to unfolding on this time scale. Further, similar transition states were observed in simulations at 100 degrees C and 225 degrees C, suggesting that high-temperature simulations provide results applicable to lower temperatures.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The analysis of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) trajectories has become one of significant biophysical interest. In deducing the transition rates between various states of a system for time-binned data, researchers have relied on simple, but often arbitrary methods of extracting rates from FRET trajectories. Although these methods have proven satisfactory in cases of well-separated, low-noise, two- or three-state systems, they become less reliable when applied to a system of greater complexity. We have developed an analysis scheme that casts single-molecule time-binned FRET trajectories as hidden Markov processes, allowing one to determine, based on probability alone, the most likely FRET-value distributions of states and their interconversion rates while simultaneously determining the most likely time sequence of underlying states for each trajectory. Together with a transition density plot and Bayesian information criterion we can also determine the number of different states present in a system in addition to the state-to-state transition probabilities. Here we present the algorithm and test its limitations with various simulated data and previously reported Holliday junction data. The algorithm is then applied to the analysis of the binding and dissociation of three RecA monomers on a DNA construct.}},

Different methods of generating optimal estimating functions are considered and a method of quantifying the loss of information due to using lower order approximations is proposed. An important feature of these methods is that an assessment of the goodness of fit to data is possible. These ideas are illustrated using a model which generalizes most of the single factor diffusion models of the short-rate interest rate used in finance.}},

The performance of the GPU's is compared to their main processor counterpart. We achieve speedups of up to 40, 80 and 150 fold, respectively. With the latest generation of GPU's one can run standard MD simulations at 10<sup>7</sup> flops/\$.}},

Here we experimentally determine a detailed energy landscape for protein folding. We generated a series of overlapping constructs containing subsets of the seven ankyrin repeats of the Drosophila Notch receptor, a protein domain whose linear arrangement of modular structural units can be fragmented without disrupting structure. To a good approximation, stabilities of each construct can be described as a sum of energy terms associated with each repeat. The magnitude of each energy term indicates that each repeat is intrinsically unstable but is strongly stabilized by interactions with its nearest neighbors. These linear energy terms define an equilibrium free energy landscape, which shows an early free energy barrier and suggests preferred low-energy routes for folding.}},

In this paper we present a different method which allows the inverse modeling of Markov jump processes based on incomplete observations in time: We consider the case of a given time series of the discretely observed jump process. We show how to compute efficiently the maximum likelihood estimator of its infinitesimal generator and demonstrate in detail that the method allows us to handle observations nonequidistant in time. The method is based on the work of and Bladt and S{\o}rensen [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B (Stat. Methodol.) 67 , 395 (2005)] but scales much more favorably than it with the length of the time series and the dimension and size of the state space of the jump process. We illustrate its performance on a toy problem as well as on data arising from simulations of biochemical kinetics of a genetic toggle switch.}},

  Abstract                 = {{▪ Abstract  Recent years have witnessed a renaissance of fluorescence microscopy techniques and applications, from live-animal multiphoton confocal microscopy to single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging in living cells. These achievements have been made possible not so much because of improvements in microscope design, but rather because of development of new detectors, accessible continuous wave and pulsed laser sources, sophisticated multiparameter analysis on one hand, and the development of new probes and labeling chemistries on the other. This review tracks the lineage of ideas and the evolution of thinking that have led to the actual developments, and presents a comprehensive overview of the field, with emphasis put on our laboratory's interest in single-molecule microscopy and spectroscopy.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We introduce a scheme for deriving an optimally parametrized Langevin dynamics of a few collective variables from data generated in molecular dynamics simulations. The drift- and the position-dependent diffusion profiles governing the Langevin dynamics are expressed as explicit averages over the input trajectories. The proposed strategy is applicable to cases when the input trajectories are generated by subjecting the system to an external time-dependent force (as opposed to canonically equilibrated trajectories). Second, it provides an explicit control on the statistical uncertainty in the drift and diffusion profiles. These features lend to the possibility of designing the external force driving the system to maximize the accuracy of the drift and diffusion profiles throughout the phase space of interest. Quantitative criteria are also provided to assess a posteriori the satisfiability of the requisites for applying the method, namely, the Markovian character of the stochastic dynamics of the collective variables.}},

In the model, a reaction coordinate moves in a multistable potential and is coupled to a thermal bath via random collisions which occur with a specified average collision frequency. The nonlinear dynamics for this system is solved numerically. It is found that the usual linear rate law for isomerization is valid for any nonzero collision frequency if the activation barrier to reaction is sufficiently high. The reasons for this behavior are discussed at length. With appropriate parameter choices, we can draw conclusions concerning the trans--gauche isomerization of n‐butane in liquids. Transition state theory is found to overestimate the rate constant by at least a factor of 2 to 3 at any collision frequency. The collisional contribution to the volume of activation is calculated. At 1 atm, the result is an order of magnitude larger in size than the transition state theory activation volume. Furthermore, this collisional contribution has a strong pressure dependence that should be observable experimentally.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Electrostatic interactions play a fundamental role in determining the structure and dynamics of biomolecules in solution. However the accurate representation of electrostatics in classical mechanics based simulation approaches such as molecular dynamics (MD) is a challenging task. Given the growing importance that MD simulation methods are taking on in the study of protein folding, protein stability and dynamics, and in structure prediction and design projects, it is important to evaluate the influence that different electrostatic schemes have on the results of MD simulations. In this paper we performed long timescale simulations (500 ns) of two peptides, beta3 and RN24 forming different secondary structures, using for each peptide four different electrostatic schemes (namely PME, reaction field correction, and cut-off schemes with and without neutralizing counterions) for a total of eight 500 ns long MD runs. The structural and conformational features of each peptide under the different conditions were evaluated in terms of the time dependence of the flexibility, secondary structure evolution, hydrogen-bonding patterns, and several other structural parameters. The degree of sampling for each simulation as a function of the electrostatic scheme was also critically evaluated. Our results suggest that, while in the case of the short peptide RN24 the performances of the four methods are comparable, PME and RF schemes perform better in maintaining the structure close to the native one for the b-sheet peptide beta3, in which long range contacts are mostly responsible for the definition of the native structure.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Protein-protein interactions are often mediated by flexible loops that experience conformational dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scales. NMR relaxation studies can map these dynamics. However, defining the network of inter-converting conformers that underlie the relaxation data remains generally challenging. Here, we combine NMR relaxation experiments with simulation to visualize networks of inter-converting conformers. We demonstrate our approach with the apo Pin1-WW domain, for which NMR has revealed conformational dynamics of a flexible loop in the millisecond range. We sample and cluster the free energy landscape using Markov State Models (MSM) with major and minor exchange states with high correlation with the NMR relaxation data and low NOE violations. These MSM are hierarchical ensembles of slowly interconverting, metastable macrostates and rapidly interconverting microstates. We found a low population state that consists primarily of holo-like conformations and is a '' hub'' visited by most pathways between macrostates. These results suggest that conformational equilibria between holo-like and alternative conformers pre-exist in the intrinsic dynamics of apo Pin1-WW. Analysis using MutInf, a mutual information method for quantifying correlated motions, reveals that WW dynamics not only play a role in substrate recognition, but also may help couple the substrate binding site on the WW domain to the one on the catalytic domain. Our work represents an important step towards building networks of inter-converting conformational states and is generally applicable. Proteins in their native state can adopt a plethora of shapes, or conformations; this conformational plasticity is critical for regulation and function in many systems. However, it has remained difficult to determine what these different conformations look like at the atomic level. We present a novel way to use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Molecular Dynamics Simulations, and Markov State Models to uncover a map of this plethora of conformations that is consistent with the available data. We applied this method to study the intrinsic dynamics used in substrate binding by the WW domain of the Pin1 proline cis-trans isomerase and found that the NMR data were best explained by two slowly-interconverting sets of many metastable conformations rather than two distinct macrostates. Substantial value is added to the NMR data by our method since it provides a kinetic '' map'' of conformational changes consistent with the observed relaxation data. Such an approach, in combination with information theory, helped us to identify specific conformational changes that might couple substrate binding at the Pin1 WW domain to the catalytic subunit.}},

From this distribution function, fluctuation formulas associated with the constant volume specific heat Cv, pressure coefficient γv, and isothermal compressibility βT are obtained. The validity of the derived distribution function and the fluctuation formulas were examined in a Lennard-Jones fluid. Cv and γv calculated from the formulas for the WC thermostat agree very well with those obtained in the canonical or microcanonical MD. {\copyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.}},

The fundamental assumption on the transitions between the states, their Markov property, is critical in this framework. We test this assumption by analyzing the transitions obtained directly from the dynamics of a molecular dynamics simulated peptide valine-proline-alanine-leucine and states defined phenomenologically using clustering in dihedral space. We find that the transitions are Markovian at the time scale of ≈ 50 ps and longer. However, at the time scale of 30--40 ps the dynamics loses its Markov property. Our methodology reveals the mechanism that leads to non-Markov behavior. It also provides a way of regrouping the conformations into new states that now possess the required Markov property of their dynamics.}},

Here, we use the combination of startstop experiments and classical fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to obtain complete intensity auto- and cross-correlation functions from picoseconds to seconds for investigating the dynamics of unfolded proteins and peptides. In combination with distance information from single-molecule transfer efficiency histograms, we can analyze the data in terms of a diffusive process on a potential of mean force to obtain intramolecular diffusion coefficients. This allows us to extend our previous analysis of the time scales of chain dynamics into the low nanosecond range for peptides and into the microsecond range for a small cold shock protein (Csp). Dynamics in short unstructured peptides can be detected down to a time scale of about 10 ns, placing a lower limit on the time scales accessible with correlation methods and currently used dye pairs. We find no evidence for microsecond fluctuations in unfolded Csp, suggesting that its global chain dynamics occur predominantly in the tens of nanosecond range. We further investigate the position dependence of these dynamics by placing donor and acceptor dyes at different positions within the chain and find a decrease in the intramolecular diffusion coefficient by a factor of 3 upon moving one of the dyes toward the center of the polypeptide. Obtaining dynamic information on a wide range of time scales from single-molecule photon statistics will be of increasing importance for the study of unfolded proteins and for biomolecules in general.}},

We restrict ourselves to polymers with relatively high line charge density τ and bare bending stiffness ð0, such as DNA or fully charged synthetic polyelectrolytes, for which the condition τ2ðBð0 > 1 (with ðB = e2/4πεkBT denoting the Bjerrum length) is satisfied. In this case the effective bending rigidity (which includes chain stiffening due to electrostatic monomer−monomer repulsion) is always larger than the screening length, and we obtain very thin adsorption layers, where the polymers essentially lie flat on the surface and can be considered as a two-dimensional layer. We distinguish different adsorbed phases, including a two-dimensional lamellar phase where the polymers run parallel and do not overlap and a disordered phase where the polymers form a random network with multiple crossings. By explicitly including lateral correlations within the adsorbed layer, we find a regime of strong charge reversal, where the adsorbed phase exhibits a much higher surface charge density than the substrate and thus reverses the charge of the substrate by a factor much larger than unity. This charge-reversed regime is characterized by a typical distance between polymers larger than the screening length. We explicitly take image charge effects due to a dielectric jump at the substrate surface and the impenetrability of the substrate for salt ions into account. These effects lead to an increase of the electrostatic persistence length close to the substrate and inhibit adsorption for strongly charged polymers and low-dielectric substrates. At the end, we present some scaling arguments for the formation of charge-oscillating multilayers.}},

For a more detailed structural interpretation of single-molecule FRET assays, information about the positions as well as the dynamics of the dye labels attached to the biomolecule is important. In this work, Rhodamine 6G (2-[3'-(ethylamino)-6'-(ethylimino)-2',7'-dimethyl-6'H-xanthen-9'-yl]-benzoic acid) bound to the 5'-end of a 20 base pair long DNA duplex is investigated by both single-molecule multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) experiments and NMR spectroscopy. Rhodamine 6G is commonly employed in nucleic acid research as a FRET dye. MFD experiments directly reveal the equilibrium of the dye bound to DNA between three heterogeneous environments, which are characterized by distinct fluorescence lifetime and intensity distributions as a result of different guanine-dye excited-state electron transfer interactions. Sub-ensemble fluorescence autocorrelation analysis shows the highly dynamic character of the dye-DNA interactions ranging from nano- to milliseconds and species-specific triplet relaxation times. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy corroborates this information by the determination of the detailed geometric structures of the dye-nucleobase complex and their assignment to each population observed in the single-molecule fluorescence experiments. From both methods, a consistent and detailed molecular description of the structural and dynamical heterogeneity is obtained.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1073/pnas.0507351102 The role of polypeptide collapse and formation of intermediates in protein folding is still under debate. Miniproteins, small globular peptide structures, serve as ideal model systems to study the basic principles that govern folding. Experimental investigations of folding dynamics of such small systems, however, turn out to be challenging, because requirements for high temporal and spatial resolution have to be met simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate how selective quenching of an extrinsic fluorescent label by the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) can be used to probe folding dynamics of Trp-cage (TC), the smallest protein known to date. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we monitor folding transitions as well as conformational flexibility in the denatured state of the 20-residue protein under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions with nanosecond time resolution. Besides microsecond folding kinetics, we reveal hierarchical folding of TC, hidden to previous experimental studies. We show that specific collapse of the peptide to a molten globule-like intermediate enhances folding efficiency considerably. A single point mutation destabilizes the intermediate, switching the protein to two-state folding behavior and slowing down the folding process. Our results underscore the importance of preformed structure in the denatured state for folding of even the smallest globular structures. A unique method emerges for monitoring conformational dynamics and ultrafast folding events of polypeptides at the nanometer scale.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The equilibrium unfolding of the Formin binding protein 28 (FBP) WW domain, a stable three-stranded β-sheet protein, can be described as reversible apparent two-state folding. Kinetics studied by laser temperature jump reveal a third state at temperatures below the midpoint of unfolding. The FBP free-energy surface can be tuned between three-state and two-state kinetics by changing the temperature, by truncation of the C terminus, or by selected point mutations. FBP WW domain is the smallest three-state folder studied to date and the only one that can be freely tuned between three-state and apparent two-state folding by several methods (temperature, truncation, and mutation). Its small size (28-37 residues), the availability of a quantitative reaction coordinate (φT), the fast folding time scale (10s of μ s), and the tunability of the folding routes by small temperature or sequence changes make this system the ideal prototype for studying more subtle features of the folding free-energy landscape by simulations or analytical theory.}},

  Abstract                 = {The kinetics and thermodynamics of complex transitions in biomolecules can be modeled in terms of a network of transitions between the relevant conformational substates. Such a transition network, which overcomes the fundamental limitations of reaction-coordinate-based methods, can be constructed either based on the features of the energy landscape, or from molecular dynamics simulations. Energy-landscape-based networks are generated with the aid of automated path-optimization methods, and, using graph-theoretical adaptive methods, can now be constructed for large molecules such as proteins. Dynamics-based networks, also called Markov State Models, can be interpreted and adaptively improved using statistical concepts, such as the mean first passage time, reactive flux and sampling error analysis. This makes transition networks powerful tools for understanding large-scale conformational changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics simulation generates large quantities of data that must be interpreted using physically meaningful analysis. A common approach is to describe the system dynamics in terms of transitions between coarse partitions of conformational space. In contrast to previous work that partitions the space according to geometric proximity, the authors examine here clustering based on kinetics, merging configurational microstates together so as to identify long-lived, i.e., dynamically metastable, states. As test systems microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the polyalanines Ala(8) and Ala(12) are analyzed. Both systems clearly exhibit metastability, with some kinetically distinct metastable states being geometrically very similar. Using the backbone torsion rotamer pattern to define the microstates, a definition is obtained of metastable states whose lifetimes considerably exceed the memory associated with interstate dynamics, thus allowing the kinetics to be described by a Markov model. This model is shown to be valid by comparison of its predictions with the kinetics obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, clustering based on the hydrogen-bonding pattern fails to identify long-lived metastable states or a reliable Markov model. Finally, an approach is proposed to generate a hierarchical model of networks, each having a different number of metastable states. The model hierarchy yields a qualitative understanding of the multiple time and length scales in the dynamics of biomolecules.},

First, the reaction pathway described by a set of collective variables between the two stable states is determined using the string method with swarms of trajectories. Then, short trajectories are initiated at different points along this pathway to build the state-to-state transition probability matrix. It is shown, using a model system, how this strategy makes it possible to use trajectories that are significantly shorter than the slowest relaxation time to efficiently build a reliable and accurate Markov model. Extensions of the method to multiple pathways, as well as some common pitfalls arising from poorly relaxed paths or an inappropriate choice of collective variables, are illustrated and discussed.}},

These advances suggest a reconciliation between the new ensemble approaches and the classical view of a folding pathway.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Simulating protein folding has been a challenging problem for decades due to the long timescales involved (compared with what is possible to simulate) and the challenges of gaining insight from the complex nature of the resulting simulation data. Markov State Models (MSMs) present a means to tackle both of these challenges, yielding simulations on experimentally relevant timescales, statistical significance, and coarse grained representations that are readily humanly understandable. Here, we review this method with the intended audience of non-experts, in order to introduce the method to a broader audience. We review the motivations, methods, and caveats of MSMs, as well as some recent highlights of applications of the method. We conclude by discussing how this approach is part of a paradigm shift in how one uses simulations, away from anecdotal single-trajectory approaches to a more comprehensive statistical approach.}},

The histogram test, based on estimated committor probabilities, is often used as a qualitative indicator for good reaction coordinates. This paper derives the mean and variance of the intrinsic committor distribution in terms of the mean and variance of the histogram of committor estimates. These convenient formulas enable the first quantitative calculations of reaction coordinate error for complex systems. An example shows that the approximate transition state surface from Peters' and Trout's reaction coordinate for nucleation in the Ising model gives a mean committor probability of 0.495 and a standard deviation of 0.042.}},

It requires fewer trajectories than a single iteration of existing procedures, and it applies to both low and high friction dynamics. The new method screens a set of candidate collective variables for a good reaction coordinate that depends on a few relevant variables. The Bayesian information criterion determines whether additional variables significantly improve the reaction coordinate. Additionally, we present an advantageous transition path sampling algorithm and an algorithm to generate the most likely transition path in the space of collective variables. The method is demonstrated on two systems: a bistable model potential energy surface and nucleation in the Ising model. For the Ising model of nucleation, we quantify for the first time the role of nuclei surface area in the nucleation reaction coordinate. Surprisingly, increased surface area increases the stability of nuclei in two dimensions but decreases nuclei stability in three dimensions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

  Abstract                 = {{The evolution of RNA conformation with Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]) is typically determined from equilibrium titration measurements or nonequilibrium single [Mg2+]-jump measurements. We study the folding of single RNA molecules in response to a series of periodic [Mg2+] jumps. The 260-residue catalytic domain of RNase P RNA from Bacillus stearothermophilus is immobilized in a microfluidic flow chamber, and the RNA conformational changes are probed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The kinetics of population redistribution after a [Mg2+] jump and the observed connectivity of FRET states reveal details of the folding pathway that complement and transcend information from equilibrium or single-jump measurements. FRET trajectories for jumps from [Mg2+] = 0.01 to 0.1 mM exhibit two-state behavior whereas jumps from 0.01 mM to 0.4 mM exhibit two-state unfolding but multistate folding behavior. RNA molecules in the low and high FRET states before the [Mg2+] increase are observed to undergo dynamics in two distinct regions of the free energy landscape separated by a high barrier. We describe the RNA structural changes involved in crossing this barrier as a '' hidden'' degree of freedom because the changes do not alter the detected FRET value but do alter the observed dynamics. The associated memory prevents the populations from achieving their equilibrium values at the end of the 5- to 10-sec [Mg2+] interval, thereby creating a nonequilibrium steady-state condition. The capability of interrogating nonequilibrium steady-state RNA conformations and the adjustable period of [Mg2+]-jump cycles makes it possible to probe regions of the free energy landscape that are infrequently sampled in equilibrium or single-jump measurements.}},

We report the 1.35 A crystal structure of Pin1 complexed with an AlaPro dipeptide and the initial characterization of Pin1's functional properties. The crystallographic structure as well as pH titration studies and mutagenesis of an active site cysteine suggest a catalytic mechanism that includes general acid-base and covalent catalysis during peptide bond isomerization. Pin1 displays a preference for an acidic residue N-terminal to the isomerized proline bond due to interaction of this acidic side chain with a basic cluster. This raises the possibility of phosphorylation-mediated control of Pin1-substrate interactions in cell cycle regulation.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The elongation cycle of protein synthesis involves the delivery of aminoacyl-transfer RNAs to the aminoacyl-tRNA-binding site (A site) of the ribosome, followed by peptide-bond formation and translocation of the tRNAs through the ribosome to reopen the A site. The translocation reaction is catalysed by elongation factor G (EF-G) in a GTP-dependent manner. Despite the availability of structures of various EF-G-ribosome complexes, the precise mechanism by which tRNAs move through the ribosome still remains unclear. Here we use multiparticle cryoelectron microscopy analysis to resolve two previously unseen subpopulations within Thermus thermophilus EF-G-ribosome complexes at subnanometre resolution, one of them with a partly translocated tRNA. Comparison of these substates reveals that translocation of tRNA on the 30S subunit parallels the swivelling of the 30S head and is coupled to unratcheting of the 30S body. Because the tRNA maintains contact with the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site (P site) on the 30S head and simultaneously establishes interaction with the exit site (E site) on the 30S platform, a novel intra-subunit 'pe/E' hybrid state is formed. This state is stabilized by domain IV of EF-G, which interacts with the swivelled 30S-head conformation. These findings provide direct structural and mechanistic insight into the 'missing link' in terms of tRNA intermediates involved in the universally conserved translocation process.}},

At large extensions, the restoring force exhibited a sawtoothlike pattern, with a periodicity that varied between 25 and 28 nanometers. Measurements of recombinant titin immunoglobulin segments of two different lengths exhibited the same pattern and allowed attribution of the discontinuities to the unfolding of individual immunoglobulin domains. The forces required to unfold individual domains ranged from 150 to 300 piconewtons and depended on the pulling speed. Upon relaxation, refolding of immunoglobulin domains was observed.}},

A considerable decrease in background light intensity and measurement time has been observed. The background light is 40 times weaker than the fluorescence signal from one molecule of Rh6G, and the correlation function with signal-to-noise ratio of 150 can be collected in 1 second.

Using programmable acousto-optical devices as beamsplitter and excitation filter, we overcome some of the limitations of conventional multichroic beamsplitters and implement rapid alternation between three laser lines. This enables to visualize the synthesis of DNA three-way junctions on a single-molecule basis and to resolve seven stoichiometric subpopulations as well as to quantify FRET in the presence of competing energy transfer pathways. Furthermore, the ability to study correlated molecular movements by monitoring several distances within a biomolecular complex simultaneously is demonstrated.}},

For thermostats that do not produce a canonical ensemble, REMD simulations are found to distort the configuration-space distributions. For bulk water, we find small deviations of the average potential energies, the buildup of tails in the potential energy distributions, and artificial correlations between the energies at different temperatures. If a solute is present, as in protein folding simulations, its conformational equilibrium can be altered. In REMD simulations of a helix-forming peptide with a weak-coupling (Berendsen) thermostat, we find that the folded state is overpopulated by about 10\% at low temperatures, and underpopulated at high temperatures. As a consequence, the enthalpy of folding deviates by almost 3 kcal/mol from the correct value. The reason for this population shift is that noncanonical ensembles with narrowed potential energy fluctuations artificially bias toward replica exchanges between low-energy folded structures at the high temperature and high-energy unfolded structures at the low temperature. We conclude that REMD simulations should only be performed in conjunction with thermostats that produce a canonical ensemble.}},

  Abstract                 = {{10.1073/pnas.2033863100 One of the most recurring questions in protein folding refers to the interplay between formation of secondary structure and hydrophobic collapse. In contrast with secondary structure, it is hard to isolate hydrophobic collapse from other folding events. We have directly measured the dynamics of protein hydrophobic collapse in the absence of competing processes. Collapse was triggered with laser-induced temperature jumps in the acid-denatured form of a simple protein and monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between probes placed at the protein ends. The relaxation time for hydrophobic collapse is only \^{a}60 ns at 305 K, even faster than secondary structure formation. At higher temperatures, as the protein becomes increasingly compact by a stronger hydrophobic force, we observe a slowdown of the dynamics of collapse. This dynamic hydrophobic effect is a high-temperature analogue of the dynamic glass transition predicted by theory. Our results indicate that in physiological conditions many proteins will initiate folding by collapsing to an unstructured globule. Local motions will presumably drive the following search for native structure in the collapsed globule.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We present a detailed statistical analysis of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy for a wide range of timescales. The derivation is completely analytical and can provide an excellent tool for planning and analysis of FCS experiments. The dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio on different measurement conditions is extensively studied. We find that in addition to the shot noise and the noise associated with correlated molecular dynamics there is another source of noise that appears at very large lag times. We call this the '' particle noise,'' as its behavior is governed by the number of particles that have entered and left the laser beam sample volume during large dwell times. The standard deviations of all the points on the correlation function are calculated analytically and shown to be in good agreement with experiments. We have also investigated the bias associated with experimental correlation function measurements. A '' phase diagram'' for FCS experiments is constructed that demonstrates the significance of the bias for any given experiment. We demonstrate that the value of the bias can be calculated and added back as a first-order correction to the experimental correlation function.}},

Applications to the potential of mean force calculation in combination with the umbrella sampling method are presented. First, the performance of the MMMM is examined in the case of butane. Compared with the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), the MMMM has an advantage with respect to the reasonable evaluation of the stationary probability distribution even from nonequilibrium trajectories. This method is then applied to Met-enkephalin nonequilibrium simulation.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The remarkable fidelity of most DNA polymerases depends on a series of early steps in the reaction pathway which allow the selection of the correct nucleotide substrate, while excluding all incorrect ones, before the enzyme is committed to the chemical step of nucleotide incorporation. The conformational transitions that are involved in these early steps are detectable with a variety of fluorescence assays and include the fingers-closing transition that has been characterized in structural studies. Using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) labeled with both donor and acceptor fluorophores, we have employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to study the polymerase conformational transitions that precede nucleotide addition. Our experiments clearly distinguish the open and closed conformations that predominate in Pol-DNA and Pol-DNA-dNTP complexes, respectively. By contrast, the unliganded polymerase shows a broad distribution of FRET values, indicating a high degree of conformational flexibility in the protein in the absence of its substrates; such flexibility was not anticipated on the basis of the available crystallographic structures. Real-time observation of conformational dynamics showed that most of the unliganded polymerase molecules sample the open and closed conformations in the millisecond timescale. Ternary complexes formed in the presence of mismatched dNTPs or complementary ribonucleotides show unique FRET species, which we suggest are relevant to kinetic checkpoints that discriminate against these incorrect substrates.}},

This model includes finite intercept effects and may even be used for heterodyne measurements. Multiple sample time measurements are considered with particular care and significant decreases of noise with increasing sample time are typically found at small as well as at large lag (and sample) times, if the standard normalization procedure is replaced by the symmetric or compensated normalization schemes. Large estimator covariances are observed across lag time ranges up to one coherence time. This type of correlated noise is typical for correlation measurements and may easily lead to overfitting problems. Experimental verifications are included for the noise calculations.}},

Imaging of single fluorescence molecules has been achieved but has so far been restricted to molecules in the immobile state. Here we provide methodology for visualization of the motion of individual fluorescent molecules. It is applied to imaging of the diffusional path of single molecules in a phospholipid membrane by using phospholipids carrying one rhodamine dye molecule. For this methodology, fluorescence microscopy was carried to a sensitivity so that single fluorescent molecules illuminated for only 5 ms were resolvable at a signal/noise ratio of 28. Repeated illuminations permitted direct observation of the diffusional motion of individual molecules with a positional accuracy of 30 nm. Such capability has fascinating potentials in bioscience--for example, to correlate biological functions of cell membranes with movements, spatial organization, and stoichiometries of individual components.}},

In a first step towards the long-range goal of describing the distribution of pathways experimentally, F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer1 (FRET) has been measured on single, freely diffusing molecules2, 3, 4. Here we use this method to determine properties of the free-energy surface for folding that have not been obtained from ensemble experiments. We show that single-molecule FRET measurements of a small cold-shock protein expose equilibrium collapse of the unfolded polypeptide and allow us to calculate limits on the polypeptide reconfiguration time. From these results, limits on the height of the free-energy barrier to folding are obtained that are consistent with a simple statistical mechanical model, but not with the barriers derived from simulations using molecular dynamics. Unlike the activation energy, the free-energy barrier includes the activation entropy and thus has been elusive to experimental determination for any kinetic process in solution.}},

The strategy is developed using benchmark systems of particular interest to bioenergy research, comprising models of cellulose and lignocellulosic biomass in an aqueous solution. The approach involves using the reaction field (RF) method for the computation of long-range electrostatic interactions, which permits efficient scaling on many thousands of cores. Although the range of applicability of the RF method for biomolecular systems remains to be demonstrated, for the benchmark systems the use of the RF produces molecular dipole moments, Kirkwood G factors, other structural properties, and mean-square fluctuations in excellent agreement with those obtained with the commonly used Particle Mesh Ewald method. With RF, three million- and five million-atom biological systems scale well up to ∼30k cores, producing ∼30 ns/day. Atomistic simulations of very large systems for time scales approaching the microsecond would, therefore, appear now to be within reach.}},

To meet this challenge, we explore the possibility of constructing accurate stochastic models of the spin label dynamics from atomistic trajectories. A systematic, two-step procedure, based on the probabilistic framework of hidden Markov models, is developed to build a discrete-time Markov chain process that faithfully captures the internal spin label dynamics on time scales longer than about 150 ps. The constructed Markov model is used both to gain insight into the long-lived conformations of the spin label and to generate the stochastic trajectories required for the simulation of ESR spectra. The methodology is illustrated with an application to the case of a spin-labeled poly alanine α helix in explicit solvent.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to study protein motions at an atomic level of detail, but they have been limited to time scales shorter than those of many biologically critical conformational changes. We examined two fundamental processes in protein dynamics---protein folding and conformational change within the folded state---by means of extremely long all-atom MD simulations conducted on a special-purpose machine. Equilibrium simulations of a WW protein domain captured multiple folding and unfolding events that consistently follow a well-defined folding pathway; separate simulations of the protein's constituent substructures shed light on possible determinants of this pathway. A 1-millisecond simulation of the folded protein BPTI reveals a small number of structurally distinct conformational states whose reversible interconversion is slower than local relaxations within those states by a factor of more than 1000.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Protein folding is difficult to simulate with classical molecular dynamics. Secondary structure motifs such as -helices and -hairpins can form in 0.1--10 s (ref. 1), whereas small proteins have been shown to fold completely in tens of microseconds2. The longest folding simulation to date is a single 1-s simulation of the villin headpiece3; however, such single runs may miss many features of the folding process as it is a heterogeneous reaction involving an ensemble of transition states4, 5. Here, we have used a distributed computing implementation to produce tens of thousands of 5--20-ns trajectories (700 s) to simulate mutants of the designed mini-protein BBA5. The fast relaxation dynamics these predict were compared with the results of laser temperature-jump experiments. Our computational predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined mean folding times and equilibrium constants. The rapid folding of BBA5 is due to the swift formation of secondary structure. The convergence of experimentally and computationally accessible timescales will allow the comparison of absolute quantities characterizing in vitro and in silico (computed) protein folding6.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Abstract: A recent paper (Yonetani, Chem. Phys. Lett. 2005, 406, 49-53) shows that in computer simulations of TIP3P water (Jorgensen et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1983, 79, 926-935) a strange layer formation can occur when a long cutoff is used. This result is counterintuitive because, in principle, increasing the cutoff should give more accurate results. Here we test this finding for different water models and try to explain why layer formation occurs. In doing so we find that under certain conditions, layer formation coincides with a sharp density increase to 1050 g/L, while simultaneously a pressure of 600 bar develops and water diffusion becomes anisotropic. This leads us to conclude that a group-based cutoff (of at least 1.4 nm) stabilizes an anomalous phase with most water models. In some cases the ordering is strengthened further by periodicity in the simulation cell, but periodicity effects can even be observed with a short cutoff (0.9 nm) and a relatively large box of 4 nm. Water models that have a relatively large quadrupole moment, more in accord with the experimental gas-phase values, in particular TIP4P (Jorgensen et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1983, 79, 926-935), are much less affected by the problem, because the dipole-dipole interaction is quenched at long distance. A comparison of different cutoff treatments, namely truncation, reaction field, particle mesh Ewald (PME), and switch and shift functions, for the simulation of water shows that only PME and shift functions yield realistic dipole-dipole interactions at long distance. The impact for biomolecular simulations is discussed.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The slow folding of a single tryptophan-containing mutant of barstar has been studied in the presence of 2 M urea at 10$\,^{\circ}$C, using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence methods and far and near-UV CD measurements. The protein folds in two major phases: a fast phase, which is lost in the dead time of measurement during which the polypeptide collapses to a compact form, is followed by a slow observable phase. During the fast phase, the rotational correlation time of Trp53 increases from 2.2 ns to 7.2 ns, and its mean fluorescence lifetime increases from 2.3 ns to 3.4 ns. The fractional changes in steady-state fluorescence, far-UV CD, and near-UV CD signals, which are associated with the fast phase are, respectively, 36 \%, 46 \%, and 16 \%. The product of the fast phase can bind the hydrophobic dye ANS. These observations together suggest that the folding intermediate accumulated at the end of the fast phase has: (a) about 20 \% of the native-state secondary structure, (b) marginally formed or disordered tertiary structure, (c) a water-intruded and mobile protein interior; and (d) solvent-accessible patches of hydrophobic groups. Measurements of the anisotropy decay of Trp53 suggest that it undergoes two types of rotational motion in the intermediate: (i) fast (τ r ≈1 ns) local motion of its indole side-chain, and (ii) a slower (τ r ≈7.2 ns) motion corresponding to global tumbling of the entire protein molecule. The ability of the Trp53 side-chain to undergo fast local motion in the intermediate, but not in the fully folded protein where it is completely buried in the hydrophobic core, suggests that the core of the intermediate is still poorly packed. The global tumbling time of the fully folded protein is faster at 5.6 ns, suggesting that the volume of the intermediate is 25 \% more than that of the fully folded protein. The rate of folding of this intermediate to the native state, measured by steady-state fluorescence, far-UV CD, and near-UV CD, is 0.07($\pm$0.01) min −1 This rate compares to a rate of folding of 0.03($\pm$0.005) min −1 , determined by double-jump experiments which monitor directly formation of native protein; and to a rate of folding of 0.05 min −1 , when determined from time-resolved anisotropy measurements of the long rotational correlation time, which relaxes from an initial value of 7.2 ns to a final value of 5.6 ns as the protein folds. On the other hand, the amplitude of the short correlation time decreases rapidly with a rate of 0.24($\pm$0.06) min −1 . These results suggest that tight packing of residues in the hydrophobic core occurs relatively early during the observable slow folding reaction, before substantial secondary and tertiary structure formation and before final compaction of the protein.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A multi-site, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer methodology has been used to study structural heterogeneity in a late folding intermediate ensemble, IL, of the small protein barstar. Four different intra-molecular distances have been measured within the structural components of IL. The IL ensemble is shown to consist of different sub-populations of molecules, in each of which one or more of the four distances are native-like and the remaining distances are unfolded-like. In very stable conditions that favor formation of IL, all four distances are native-like in most molecules. In less stable conditions, one or more distances are unfolded-like. As stability is decreased, the proportion of molecules with unfolded-like distances increases. Thus, the results show that protein folding intermediates are ensembles of different structural forms, and they demonstrate that conformational entropy increases as structures become less stable. These observations provide direct experimental evidence in support of a basic tenet of energy landscape theory for protein folding, that available conformational space, as represented by structural heterogeneity in IL, becomes restricted as the stability is increased. The results also vindicate an important prediction of energy landscape theory, that different folding pathways may become dominant under different folding conditions. In more stable folding conditions, uniformly native-like compactness is achieved during folding to IL, whereas in less stable conditions, uniformly native-like compactness is achieved only later during the folding of IL to N.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A hybrid analysis that combines the maximum entropy method (MEM) with nonlinear least squares (NLS) fitting has been developed to interpret a general time-dependent signal. Data that include processes of opposite sign and a slow baseline drift can be inverted to obtain both a continuous distribution of lifetimes and a sum of discrete exponentials. Fits by discrete exponentials are performed with initial parameters determined from the distribution of lifetimes obtained with the MEM. The regularization of the parameter space achieved by the MEM stabilizes the introduction of each successive exponential in the NLS fits. This hybrid approach is particularly useful when fitting by a large number of exponentials. Revision of the MEM '' prior'' based on features in the data can improve the lifetime distribution obtained. Standard errors in the mean are estimated automatically for raw data. The results presented for simulated data and for fluorescence measurements of protein folding illustrate the utility and accuracy of the hybrid algorithm. Analysis of the folding of dihydrofolate reductase reveals six kinetic processes, one more than previously reported.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Molecular mechanics simulations offer a computational approach to study the behavior of biomolecules at atomic detail, but such simulations are limited in size and timescale by the available computing resources. State-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) can perform over 500 billion arithmetic operations per second, a tremendous computational resource that can now be utilized for general purpose computing as a result of recent advances in GPU hardware and software architecture. In this article, an overview of recent advances in programmable GPUs is presented, with an emphasis on their application to molecular mechanics simulations and the programming techniques required to obtain optimal performance in these cases. We demonstrate the use of GPUs for the calculation of long-range electrostatics and nonbonded forces for molecular dynamics simulations, where GPU-based calculations are typically 10-100 times faster than heavily optimized CPU-based implementations. The application of GPU acceleration to biomolecular simulation is also demonstrated through the use of GPU-accelerated Coulomb-based ion placement and calculation of time-averaged potentials from molecular dynamics trajectories. A novel approximation to Coulomb potential calculation, the multilevel summation method, is introduced and compared with direct Coulomb summation. In light of the performance obtained for this set of calculations, future applications of graphics processors to molecular dynamics simulations are discussed.}},

  Abstract                 = {Repeat proteins are composed of tandem structural modules in which close contacts do not extend beyond adjacent repeats. Despite the local nature of these close contacts, repeat proteins often unfold as a single, highly coupled unit. Previous studies on the Notch ankyrin domain suggest that this lack of equilibrium unfolding intermediates results both from stabilizing interfaces between each repeat and from a roughly uniform distribution of stability across the folding energy landscape. To investigate this idea, we have generated 15 variants of the Notch ankyrin domain with single and multiple destabilizing substitutions that make the energy landscape uneven. By applying a free energy additivity analysis to these variants, we quantified the destabilization threshold over which repeats 6 and 7 decouple from repeats 1-5. The free energy coupling limit suggested by this additivity analysis ({approx}4 kcal/mol) is also reflected in m-value analysis and in differences among equilibrium unfolding transitions as monitored by CD versus fluorescence for all 15 variants. All of these observations are quantitatively predicted by analyzing the response of the experimentally determined energy landscape to increasing unevenness. These results highlight the importance of a uniform distribution of local stability in achieving cooperative unfolding. 10.1073/pnas.0608756104},

  Abstract                 = {{The dynamical behavior of many systems arising in physics, chemistry, biology, etc. is dominated by rare but important transition events between long lived states. For over 70 years, transition state theory (TST) has provided the main theoretical framework for the description of these events [17,33,34]. Yet, while TST and evolutions thereof based on the reactive flux formalism [1, 5] (see also [30,31]) give an accurate estimate of the transition rate of a reaction, at least in principle, the theory tells very little in terms of the mechanism of this reaction. Recent advances, such as transition path sampling (TPS) of Bolhuis, Chandler, Dellago, and Geissler [3, 7] or the action method of Elber [15, 16], may seem to go beyond TST in that respect: these techniques allow indeed to sample the ensemble of reactive trajectories, i.e. the trajectories by which the reaction occurs. And yet, the reactive trajectories may again be rather uninformative about the mechanism of the reaction. This may sound paradoxical at first: what more than actual reactive trajectories could one need to understand a reaction? The problem, however, is that the reactive trajectories by themselves give only a very indirect information about the statistical properties of these trajectories. This is similar to why statistical mechanics is not simply a footnote in books about classical mechanics. What is the probability density that a trajectory be at a given location in state-space conditional on it being reactive? What is the probability current of these reactive trajectories? What is their rate of appearance? These are the questions of interest and they are not easy to answer directly from the ensemble of reactive trajectories. The right framework to tackle these questions also goes beyond standard equilibrium statistical mechanics because of the nontrivial bias that the very definition of the reactive trajectories imply -- they must be involved in a reaction. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the probabilistic framework one can use to characterize the mechanism of a reaction and obtain the probability density, current, rate, etc. of the reactive trajectories.}},

  Abstract                 = {{PMID: 20070076 To date, the slowest-folding proteins folded ab initio by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have had folding times in the range of nanoseconds to microseconds. We report simulations of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1−39), a protein which has a folding time of ∼1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to ∼40 μs for several temperatures and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding rate (∼640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with pfold > 0.5, suggesting β12 hairpin formation may be rate-limiting. We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer time scales than ever before.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We have used one- (OPE) and two-photon (TPE) excitation with time-correlated single-photon counting techniques to determine time-resolved fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays of the wild-type Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and two red-shifted mutants, S65T-GFP and RSGFP. WT-GFP and S65T-GFP exhibited a predominant approximately 3 ns monoexponential fluorescence decay, whereas for RSGFP the main lifetimes were approximately 1.1 ns (main component) and approximately 3.3 ns. The anisotropy decay of WT-GFP and S65T-GFP was also monoexponential (global rotational correlation time of 16 +/- 1 ns). The approximately 1.1 ns lifetime of RSGFP was associated with a faster rotational depolarization, evaluated as an additional approximately 13 ns component. This feature we attribute tentatively to a greater rotational freedom of the anionic chromophore. With OPE, the initial anisotropy was close to the theoretical limit of 0.4; with TPE it was higher, approaching the TPE theoretical limit of 0.57 for the colinear case. The measured power dependence of the fluorescence signals provided direct evidence for TPE. The general independence of fluorescence decay times, rotation correlation times, and steady-state emission spectra on the excitation mode indicates that the fluorescence originated from the same distinct excited singlet states (A*, I*, B*). However, we observed a relative enhancement of blue fluorescence peaked at approximately 440 nm for TPE compared to OPE, indicating different relative excitation efficiencies. We infer that the two lifetimes of RSGFP represent the deactivation of two substates of the deprotonated intermediate (I*), distinguished by their origin (i.e., from A* or B*) and by nonradiative decay rates reflecting different internal environments of the excited-state chromophore.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We construct a statistical theory of reactive trajectories between two
pre-specified sets A and B, i.e. the portionsof the path of a Markov
process during which the path makes a transition from A to B. This
problem is relevant e.g. in the context of metastability, in which case
the two sets A and B are metastable sets, though the formalism we
propose is independent of any such assumptions on A and B. We show that
various probability distributions on the reactive trajectories can be
expressed in terms of the equilibrium distribution of the process and
the so-called committor functions which give the probability that the
process reaches first B before reaching A, either backward or forward in
time. Using these objects, we obtain (i) the distribution of reactive
trajectories, which gives the proportion of time reactive trajectories
spend in sets outside of A and B; (ii) the hitting point distribution of
the reactive trajectories on a surface, which measures where the
reactive trajectories hit the surface when they cross it; (iii) the last
hitting point distribution of the reactive trajectories on the surface;
(iv) the probability current of reactive trajectories, the integral of
which on a surface gives the net average flux of reactive trajectories
across this surface; (v) the average frequency of reactive trajectories,
which gives the average number of transitions between A and B per unit
of time; and (vi) the traffic distribution of reactive trajectories,
which gives some information about the regions the reactive trajectories
visit regardless of the time they spend in these regions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Small single-domain proteins often exhibit only a single free-energy barrier, or transition state, between the denatured and the native state. The folding kinetics of these proteins is usually explored via mutational analysis. A central question is which structural information on the transition state can be derived from the mutational data. In this article, we model and structurally interpret mutational ¦-values for two small ²-sheet proteins, the PIN and the FBP WW domains. The native structure of these WW domains comprises two ²-hairpins that form a three-stranded ²-sheet. In our model, we assume that the transition state consists of two conformations in which either one of the hairpins is formed. Such a transition state has been recently observed in molecular dynamics folding-unfolding simulations of a small designed three-stranded ²-sheet protein. We obtain good agreement with the experimental data 1), by splitting up the mutation-induced free-energy changes into terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the proteins; and 2), by fitting a single parameter, the relative degree to which hairpins 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state. The model helps us to understand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains, and captures also negative ¦-values that have been difficult to interpret.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We investigate the challenges and limitations that are encountered when studying membrane protein dynamics in vivo by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Based on theoretical arguments and computer simulations, we show that, in general, the fluctuating fluorescence has a fractal dimension D(0) >or= 1.5, which is determined by the anomality alpha of the diffusional motion of the labeled particles, i.e., by the growth of their mean square displacement as (Deltax)(2) approximately t(alpha). The fractality enforces an initial power-law behavior of the autocorrelation function and related quantities for small times. Using this information, we show by FCS that Golgi resident membrane proteins move subdiffusively in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in vivo. Based on Monte Carlo simulations for FCS on curved surfaces, we can rule out that the observed anomalous diffusion is a result of the complex topology of the membrane. The apparent mobility of particles as determined by FCS, however, is shown to depend crucially on the shape of the membrane and its motion in time. Due to this fact, the hydrodynamic radius of the tracked particles can be easily overestimated by an order of magnitude.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules1. The primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein's native structure. Theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding1, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. Simple folding models2, 3 show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding4, 5. For some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants6. Where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. Such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the R15, R16 and R17 domains of α-spectrin. R15 folds \~{}3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities7, 8, 9, 10. Here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of R16 and R17. We use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. Theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a 'normal' protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond--second, timescale.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Single molecule experiments reveal intriguing phenomenon in chemical and biological systems. Several indicators of complex dynamics, including "intensity" correlations, "event" correlations, and characteristic functions have been proposed, but extraction of information from these indicators can be difficult since these indicators only observe certain characteristics of the system. Generally, for systems that follow Poisson kinetics, all of these indicators contain similar information about the relaxation times of the system and the connections between different relaxation times, but the information is convoluted in different ways so the strength of various indicators is system specific. The paper discusses the theoretical implications and information content of various data analysis methods for single molecule experiments and demonstrates the relationships between indicators. Under certain conditions, common indicators contain all available information about systems with Poisson kinetics between degenerate states, but extraction of this information is generally not numerically feasible. The paper also discusses practical issues associated with these analyses, which motivates a numerical study based on Bayes' formula in the companion paper [J. Witkoskie and J. S. Cao, J. Chem.

  Abstract                 = {{The kinetics of chain disruption and collapse of staphylococcal nuclease after positive or negative pressure jumps was monitored by real-time small-angle x-ray scattering under pressure. We used this method to probe the overall conformation of the protein by measuring its radius of gyration and pair-distance-distribution function p ( r ) which are sensitive to the spatial extent and shape of the particle. At all pressures and temperatures tested, the relaxation profiles were well described by a single exponential function. No fast collapse was observed, indicating that the rate limiting step for chain collapse is the same as that for secondary and tertiary structure formation. Whereas refolding at low pressures occurred in a few seconds, at high pressures the relaxation was quite slow, 1 h, due to a large positive activation volume for the rate-limiting step for chain collapse. A large increase in the system volume upon folding implies significant dehydration of the transition state and a high degree of similarity in terms of the packing density between the native and transition states in this system. This study of the time-dependence of the tertiary structure in pressure-induced folding/unfolding reactions demonstrates that novel information about the nature of protein folding transitions and transition states can be obtained from a combination of small-angle x-ray scattering using high intensity synchrotron radiation with the high pressure perturbation technique.}},

However, the knowledge of the correct SD is necessary for an accurate data evaluation, especially when fitting theoretical models to experimental data. In this work, an algorithm is presented that considers the essential features of FCS. It allows prediction of the performance of FCS measurements in various cases, which is important for finding optimal experimental conditions. The program calculates the SD of the experimental autocorrelation function online. This procedure leads to improved parameter estimation, compared to currently used theoretical approximations for the SD. Three methods for the calculation of the SD are presented and compared to earlier analytical solutions (D. E. Koppel. 1974. Phys. Rev. A. 10:19381945.), calculation directly from fluorescence intensity values, by averaging several FCS measurements, or by dividing one measurement into a set of shorter data packages. Although the averaging over several measurements yields accurate estimates for the SD, the other two methods are considerably less time consuming, can be run online, and yield comparable results.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Characterization of transient intermediate or transition states is crucial for the description of biomolecular folding pathways, which is, however, difficult in both experiments and computer simulations. Such transient states are typically of low population in simulation samples. Even for simple systems such as RNA hairpins, recently there are mounting debates over the existence of multiple intermediate states. In this paper, we develop a computational approach to explore the relatively low populated transition or intermediate states in biomolecular folding pathways, based on a topological data analysis tool, MAPPER, with simulation data from large-scale distributed computing. The method is inspired by the classical Morse theory in mathematics which characterizes the topology of high-dimensional shapes via some functional level sets. In this paper we exploit a conditional density filter which enables us to focus on the structures on pathways, followed by clustering analysis on its level sets, which helps separate low populated intermediates from high populated folded/unfolded structures. A successful application of this method is given on a motivating example, a RNA hairpin with GCAA tetraloop, where we are able to provide structural evidence from computer simulations on the multiple intermediate states and exhibit different pictures about unfolding and refolding pathways. The method is effective in dealing with high degree of heterogeneity in distribution, capturing structural features in multiple pathways, and being less sensitive to the distance metric than nonlinear dimensionality reduction or geometric embedding methods. The methodology described in this paper admits various implementations or extensions to incorporate more information and adapt to different settings, which thus provides a systematic tool to explore the low-density intermediate states in complex biomolecular folding systems.}},

U.S.A. 2000, 97, 7220). Motivated by these experiments, we study loop-closure kinetics for two peptides of different lengths, Cys-(Ala-Gly-Gln)n-Trp (n = 1, 2), in multiple all-atom explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations with different initial conditions and force fields. In 150 simulations of approximately 20 ns each, we collect data covering 1.0 and 0.8 mus for the penta-peptide simulated with the AMBER and CHARMM force fields, respectively, and about 0.5 mus each with the two force fields for the octa-peptide. These extensive simulations allow us to analyze the dynamics of peptides in the unfolded state with atomic resolution, thus probing early events in protein folding, and to compare molecular dynamics simulations directly with experiment. The calculated lifetimes of the tryptophan triplet state are in the range of 50100 ns, in agreement with experimental measurements. However, end-to-end contacts form more rapidly, with characteristic times less than 10 ns. The contact formation rates for the two force fields are similar despite differences in the respective ensembles of peptide conformations.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The folding reaction of acid-unfolded cytochrome c in the presence of various amounts of KCl was investigated with Trp fluorescence and resonance Raman spectroscopies. It was found that the too-early-too-much polypeptide chain collapse induced by KCl yields some stable folding intermediates, which need to overcome a higher energy barrier to fold into their native conformation. We propose that the charge distribution on the polypeptide chain is part of the folding codon encoded in the linear amino acid sequence. The charge screening effect introduced by KCl alters the shape of the energy landscape by raising the slope of the upper rim and introduces a rugged energy surface toward the bottom of the folding funnel.}},

MSMs partition the conformation space into a set of nonoverlapping metastable states, and we can calculate spectra signal for each of these states using the NEP method. Thus the overall spectroscopic observable for a given system is simply the sum of spectra of different metastable states weighted by their populations. We show that results from MSMs constructed from a large number of simulations have a much better agreement with the equilibrium experimental 2DIR spectra compared to that generated from straightforward MD simulations starting from the folded state. This indicates that a sufficient sampling of important relevant conformational states is critical for calculating the accurate spectroscopic observables. MSMs are also capable of simulating the unfolding relaxation dynamics upon the temperature jump. The agreement of the simulation using MSMs and NEP with the experiment not only provides a justification for our protocol, but also provides the physical insight of the underlying spectroscopic observables. The protocol we developed has the potential to be extended to simulate a wide range of fast triggering plus optical detection experiments for biomolecules.

It is shown here that the statistical uncertainty due to this kind of average is of the order of 1/T1/2. The coefficient of the square root is related to a characteristic relaxation time of the correlation function. If only time averaging is performed, the resulting statistical uncertainty in typical computer experiments may be of the order of 20\%.}},
